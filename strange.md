# Caveat Emptor The Diabolical World of Andrew Bartzis

> You need power only when you want to do something harmful;  otherwise, love is enough to get everything done. 

> -- Charlie Chaplin

If you have an interest in the supernatural; 
if you're what they called in the early twentieth century a _seeker_; 
or if you're a connoisseur of the paranormal, 
the conspiratorial, 
the mysterious itself, 
then perhaps you've heard the name _Andrew Bartzis_,
or perhaps you know him by his self-given appelation, 
_the galactic historian_,
then you would know that he bills himself as a master reader of the akashic records.


Bartzis is a big name in a small world,  
a niche subculture of renegade spiritual discourse that springs off the success of people like David Icke
&mdash;
a former British footballer and sports announcer for the BBC who committed social and career suicide when he announced publicly in the early nineties that a shapeshifting reptilian race runs the world
&mdash;
and most people who stay abreast of current events even to the margins of acceptable ideas have heard of Icke. 
What most people don't know is that a signifcant subculture of conspiracy theory,
new spiritual paradigms,
UFOs,
chanelling,
white and black magic,
and,
of course,
akashic records emerged after Ike's seminal disclosure,
and with it came people like Andrew Bartzis.


## Galactic History


My journey into the world of telling other people's stories begin in the middle of 2019.
Bereft of consistent remote work in my trade as a technical writer,
and newly acclimatizing myself to living deep in the rainforest of Costa Rica in an earthbag house I had built with my son,
I commenced a cycle of creative writing that manifested three books.
The first was based on a man named John Edmonds and a place called Stardust Ranch in Buckeye Arizona.
You may be familiar with another very strange ranch called Skinwalker Ranch. 
It has a television show in its fourth season.  
Stardust is like that on steroids.
The collaboration with John culminated in _Stardust Ranch: The Incredible True Story_,
which has become something of a cult classic of this genre three and a half years later.


The next book was called _The Light Of Darkness: A Warrior's Tale for Our Time_.
It chronicled the life and insights of Robert Wiegand,
a Navy SEAL with a half dozen near-death experiences.
Bob's tale is the most chilling I've ever written. 
It's not for the faint of heart,
but after Stardust Ranch I got the bug to go deeper into the world John Edmonds introduced to me:
&mdash;
alien visitation, 
abduction, 
time loss,
alien government convergence, 
portals, 
paranormal activity,  
the dark world of the hell regions, 
and the fate of the human race
&mdash;
then came the third book a year later,
_The Galactic Historian: The World According to Andrew Bartzis_.

The first two men, 
John Edmonds and Robert Wiegand,  
were good men with a sincere interest in the future of the human race.  
They had their hearts in the game.
Bartzis is another story.


## Coming Out


Bartzis emerged on the public scene in 2013. 
His reputation had been growing behind the scenes. 
No significant interview had been done with him as of then. 
He was reputed to be a super psychic and a master reader of the akashic records,
capable of weaving grand narratives through fifty-five million years of history on this planet.
This coming out party took place at Mount Shasta, 
a kind of Cistine Chapel for the new age,
known for UFO sightings and other paranormal events. 
He submitted to a twelve-hour interview with an elder statesman of this movement who went by the handle of _Lance the Zany Mystic_.

It's well worth the watch. 
Bartzis does have an ability to encapsulate history in a multidimensional way. 
Whether or not it is in fact the result of an advanced reading of the akashic records,
who can say?
I would say he has a mild psychic ability
&mdash;
about ten percent of what he claims
&mdash;
and the rest of his narratives are cobbled together by the intuitive concatenation of research.
He speaks from a place that's not a trance state but but some kind of inspired dispatch, 
but an imperfect state that allows for a lot of mistakes in his material. 

Nonetheless,
after that interview a new age rockstar was born. 
Rumor has it that back then Bartzis was charging $5,000 US dollars for a one hour psychic reading. 
He spent a number of years jet setting around the world at the behest of the super rich.  
He started an internet radio show in which he would do partial readings for people, 
a kind of appetizer to get the big bucks for the paid reading,
and people started clamoring to be in his inner circle.


## Falling Out


Shortly after finishing _The Galactic Historian: The World According To Andrew Bartzis_, 
the first book I had written in this trilogy 
&mdash;
_Stardust Ranch: The Incredible True Story_.
&mdash;
began to crest. 
I was contacted by a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School. 
He wanted to know if I would approach John Edmonds about an experiment that he and his supervising colleague, 
a gentleman with a PhD in medical physics, 
wanted to conduct at Stardust Ranch. 
I  brokered a meeting between the three of us and John Edmonds. 
A fourth person appeared for the Zoom meeting,
a woman involved in television production who had worked on Skinwalker Ranch and Blind Frog Ranch,
both succesful television shows.  

We had a cordial first meeting with John and we were all set to go forward with the experiment. 
The television producer asked for a sidebar and negotiations began for a possible TV series about Stardust Ranch. 
Given that I had just recently completed _The Galactic Historian, The World According To Andrew Bartzis_, 
and Bartzis and I were communicating on a near daily basis, 
I informed him of the news. 
He asked if he could meet the television producer.  
I agreed and set up the meeting. 
I sat in on a three-hour Skype call in which Bartzis gave a healing to the woman who had been damaged by some childhood trauma. 
This was not the first time I had seen Bartzis do his work. 
He had some weeks earlier asked to meet John Edmonds. 
On his first request I said no. 
He persisted. 
I relented. 
He did the same thing with John, 
a long three hour Skype call that was a healing of sorts.  
John was very grateful. 


It was shortly after these two meetings and two long conversations that Bartzis started to talk to me openly about how we should write the TV series.  
The pronoun _we_ startled me. 
Bartzis had invited himself onto a TV writing team without a TV contract being signed and without anything that I would consider to be professional writing experience. 
John Edmonds was firm with the TV producers
&mdash;
if a show went forward he and I would write it
&mdash;
and Bartzis knew this.
I saw him in a new way. 
The introduction to John Edmonds and the TV producer was calculated. 
Bartzis can see timelines and potentialities.
He had seen my future and knew this pocket of opportunity with Harvard and television was coming.
He set the whole thing up to advance his own position and cement himself into my earned opportunity,
and suddenly we were not even marketing _The Galactic Historian: The World According To Andrew Bartzis_,
now it was all about how Stardust Ranch could carry Andrew to a greater audience.
What shocked me was how he used his powers. 
It was like a woman using her looks to get her way without any promise of actually giving intimacy to the man. 
It was prostitution in its purest form. 
Andrew Bartzis pimped himself right in front of my eyes, 
and not once, 
twice.



At no point in this story am I going to deny the capabilities of Bartzis.  
He really can read the akashic records,
and he really can heal people,
but keep in mind, 
so could _John of God_, 
the Brazilian spiritual healer now incarcerated for multiple counts of rape and human trafficking,
and the subject of a four-part Netflix documentary series titled,
_John of God: The Crimes of a Spiritual Healer_.


The next time Bartzis brought up the topic of TV writing I halted the conversation.
It was time to be firm.
I did not want to write professionally with him.
He threw a temper tantrum like a spoiled eight-year-old child. 
He insisted I was hurting him emotionally,
and,
further,
he suggested intimate things about my own psychology that were behind it.
I was the problem.
Bartzis was not the selfish one.
To grow I needed to let him on the writing team.
I'm not sure how many times this desperate play had worked for him in the past,
but I wasn't buying it at all.
His reaction cemented my position.
I told him I could not carry him on a writing project and that I had been waiting for an opportunity like this for twenty-five years,
writing every day of my life.
He did not relent his position.
Nor did I.
Our relationship was fractured from that moment onward,
and it never recovered.


John Edmonds had told me that attention brought to the ranch had to be done in measure and we had to be careful. 
Sudden explosive attention could jeopardize his health and well-being. 
He had a delicate truce with the entities that used the ranch.  
Andrew steamed forward.  
John Edmonds was viciously attacked. 
His heart was torn open in seven spots in the main artery, 
the one doctors call the widow maker. 
He went into the hospital and never came out. 
On Febuary 28th,
2022 he died in a hospice in Arizona,
and with his death all the potential opportunity disappeared, 
the experiment with Harvard Medical School and the television series, 
which had progressed to the producers visiting the ranch for a weekend and beginning negotiation for the rights to John's story. 


This is when I began to suspect an even deeper darkness than cupidity in Bartzis.
I would later learn as the months and years rolled by that I was not an aberration in his behavior, 
not an uncontrollable temptation that brought the worst out of him in the form of a television opportunity, 
rather this was the standard Andrew Bartzis,  
and I was just one in a long list of people who had been abused by Andrew Bartzis.
Shortly after the opportunity with the television writing evaporated he disappeared from my life and does not pay royalties on the book that I wrote for him. 


Even with all of this nonsense I never had the idea to write an expose on Bartzis. 
I just took it as a life lesson and moved on. 
Psychics are flaky people. 
And they're really not that spiritual at all. 
My life was going good and I had found a lot of really good technical writing work and there was no need to quarrel over a few thousand dollars in royalties.  
It wasn't until people started reaching out to me and I started hearing even darker stories about Bartzis that I felt a responsibility to investigate. 



## The Real Andrew Bartzis

Most people who spoke to me were quite frightened. 
You see, 
magic is real. 
The ability to attack someone in dreams, 
steal their energy, 
associate negative entities or even demons with them, 
and even kill them is all possible under the umbrella of magic,
especially if the target has no spiritual protection.
It's not fashionable to talk about these things in an age of black box rationality.
I sometimes think the Industrial Revolution murdered the human imagination, 
and the imagination is the doorway to all things magical.
Magic is now the province of religious nutters and perhaps gypsies,
But the religious nutters make everything about their demonic legion from the Bible and don't really understand the finer points of magic, 
so nobody really listens to them,
and gypsies? 
Nobody has ever listened to them,  with the exception of maybe the Peaky Blinders television series on Netflix.
The disparity between what people will entertain when they are told it is entertainment and what they will entertain when they're defining their reality is staggering.
But that doesn't mean magic is not real.
It's as real as rain.


Eleanor is the story's beginning,
an uncommonly attractive woman of natural beauty, 
who,
in 2010,
was living a comfortable life with a very wealthy husband in Barbados. 
It was here she met the man who would become the right hand to Andrew Bartzis,  
one David Dean Ellis.

"I used to go to a very high-end gym in a golf resort here. 
He was a personal trainer at that gym. 
That was my first point of contact. 
In that time he tried to get me to have an affair with him, 
which was unsuccessful."


Ellis is a piece of work himself.
He was a _fixer_ before joining the _spiritual_ community,
a Canadian who lived in Barbados for some time,
then returned to Canada about a year ago,
rural Sakatchewan of all places.

"He used to do a lot of dirty work for politicians and God knows he was always involved in what we call the underworld.
And the necessary societies of Barbados. 
So he's a voodoo practitioner, 
he's a black magic practitioner. 
He was involved anywhere he could get his claws into power."



Eleanor was introduced to elements of the Barbadian magical world by Ellis.
The average person would be amazed how much organized magic is around them at any given time in any given society, 
from the poorest villages in South  America and Africa to the plush suburbs and penthouses of North American cities. 
Magid is a major force in the world today,  
but, 
much like sexual subcultures, 
swingers for example, 
if you're not _in the loop_ you'd never know it's going on around you.  
According to Eleanor, 
not only is Barbados no exception to the rule of magic proliferation, 
it's in full swing,
and it holds a special interest for the rich and powerful in Barbados, 
so getting into magic can advance your social status on this Caribbean island.
Ellis initiated Eleanor into a Celtic white magic society in Barbados.

"I only stayed within for one year because I realized that some of the teachings were solid. 
But I could see that a lot of people were getting corrupted."

It got quite dark quite quickly for Eleanor.
Ellis and his group began to focus on her husband. 
He had a lot of money. 
The wife of a man like that would inherit a lot of money if something were to happen to him.


"They basically told me that they would put something in my husband's drink. 
We lived over a big gully that I could push him off.
Right. 
If he dropped, he would die. 
So they told me that their people would come and pick up his body."



You might very well ask yourself why someone would stay in the occult after overtures toward murdering her husband had been made in the first year of her association with one magical society? 
The occult is the ultimate seductor. 
Once it gets its hooks into you it can be more compelling than narcotics, 
alcohol, sex, 
or any other addiction or obsession. 
It's all about the power. 
A faithful devotee of God could spend years in the absence of any real sign or meaningful interaction with the divine, 
subsisting on a strained faith, 
whereas the occult offers phenomenological morsels all the way through the forest,
not dissimilar to the bread crumbs left by a witch in a Grimm's Fairy Tale. 
Eleanor was fascinated with the occult. 
She believed,
as many do,
that it is a true spiritual path to self-realization and God consciousness. 
The occult can be very spiritually productive when it's morally and ethically practiced. 
However,
it seems to have its best expression in cultures with long and open histories of its utility, 
like India. 
Western versions of occult practice and initiation almost always end in catastrophe.



It was some years later in her occult journey,
2016 to her recollection,
that Eleanor was sent a video of Bartzis with his then lover, 
Natalie,
now dead of a fast-acting cancer, 
a fate that would come to be quite normal for people close to Bartzis.



"It was most fascinating (the video) because you know how these people work, 
they're like dream catchers. 
They have like the beads, 
which are the pearls of knowledge, right? 
But when you go in for the beads and the pearls you get trapped in the dream catcher, 
that's how they really operate."

Natalie was the wife of  a billionaire. 
Right away we see a character in Bartzis similar to the country club black magic hustler David Ellis. 
The whole time that Bartzis was in a relationship with Natalie her husband was unaware. 
Bartzis was pretending to be gay.
The affair was carried on right in front of Natalie's husband and her mother, 
who lived with her. 
They were aristocrats, 
just the kind of target that people like Ellis and Bartzis favor. 


According to Eleanor, 
who became Natalie's confidant,
Natalie evolved to see the very dark side Bartzis keeps so well hidden from the general public, 
and she threatened to expose him. 
It was around this time that Natalie got a fast acting cancer in the thymus and was dead within six weeks.
The fast-acting cancer death appears too many times around Bartzis for it to be a coincidence.



Eleanor ended up inviting Bartzis to Barbados after she left her husband,
legally,
of course,
not the accidental tumble over the cliff Ellis and his coven suggested.
At a physical level, 
Bartzis is absolutely repugnant. 
He has an autoimmune disorder that has his skin flaking and peeling off in large chunks and his whole body is like one giant sore from psoriasis. 
He has sores on his genitalia and he's had a bad stomach most of his life.
Anybody who does his laundry sees blood and feces in his clothes. 
He bleeds from his anus.
He smells poorly and his hygiene is horrible.  
He's terribly overweight and his god-given features of face and frame are less than attractive.

The seduction is who these women think he is. 
And like any good pimp, 
Bartzis is always quick to remind his lover that he she's his _number one_ girl. 
Apparently there's a line he uses and he used it on an Eleanor.

"I'm the only one on the planet with a specific type of DNA,
and because of this he wanted to make a baby with me."


Bartzis ended up moving to Barbados and into the home of Eleanor,
another rich woman to take care of him,
though Eleanor was interested only in spiritual development.
She had a lover while Bartzis played multidimensional pool boy.
However,
he played the spiritual angle to his best advantage.
He convinced Eleanor and her lover that he could induce a kundalini awakening in them if he were allowed to _coach_ them through a sex session, 
and he insisted on filming it.  
That would come back to haunt Eleanor in a horrible way. 
She arrived at the same point that Natalie arrived at. 
There was something off about this galactic historian.  


In the course of her relationship with Bartzis, 
one of Eleanor's sons got tumors in his stomach. 
They were not cancerous but they needed to be cut out. 
Her ex-husband also got cancer. 
While working on _The Galactic Historian: The World According to Andrew Bartzis_ my horse died and my dog got cancer and died.
I live on a farm and animal death is not new to me,
but there was something off about the two animals that died.



Eleanor introduced Ellis and Bartzis. 
Ellis is the only person who has survived in the inner circle through several cycles of death and corporate realignment. 
Eleanor got out.
They robbed her house,
or,
at the very least,
Ellis arranged the robbery.
Even the art work of her middle school children was destroyed.
It was mayhem.
She'd had enough.
She booted them out of her life,
but it couldn't be that clean a cut.
Like Natalie,
Eleanor had seen too much.
She feared for her life,
and it took some convincing to get her to speak to me for this article.
Fortunately for her Ellis and Bartzis didn't have to kill her.
Remember that Kundalini awakening session Bartzis filmed?
It was sent to all of the office employees of her ex's construction firm, 
and Bartzis and Ellis warned her that if she didn't keep her mouth shut it would find its way into the inboxes of her children's teachers.
This article does not rebuke the practice of Tantra for the elevation of consciousness. 
I myself do not practice it nor do I find it useful, 
but in serious Tantra schools it has helped many people overcome limitations of consciousness and grow.  
However, 
the sacred sensual would never be used by a tantric Guru to blackmail a student.
This is the spiritual teacher, 
Andrew Bartzis.



## Back in the USA 

Bartzis moved back to the United States. 
He bought a home in Ohio where his parents lived and settled back into giving readings and promoting himself on social media. 
He very quickly formed another inner circle. 
One of the principal characters and servants of Bartzis's mission during this period was an Australian fellow by the name of Andre Hodge.  
He's an affable and handsome fellow who continues his own spiritual service through his YouTube channel _ServantofTruth_.
It only took a couple of years for the whole negative cycle to repeat itself.
