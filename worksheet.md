## The Death of Robert Brown


Robert Brown had been a multi-year audio-visual producer for the galactic historian and his entourage. 
This mainly amounted to hosting Zoom meetings where the _Great Bartzitzy_  would give partial readings to tease people into paying the $1,500 for a full hour. 
I was repulsed by his money grubbing. 
There's nothing wrong with pursuing money. 
It's a legitimate karmic cycle. 
We live in a free will space. 
But when you're billing yourself as a spiritual teacher it's not all right. 
Spiritual work by spiritual law cannot be charged. 
You might think I'm crazy for saying that out loud, 
but it's true. 
It's part of the spiritual law down here. 
This should immediately tell you a lot about the new class of psychic pretender promising to amplify your business revenues, 
your love life, 
and everything about your life. 
It's a complete sham. 
And, 
more importantly, 
it's an offense to all that all is truly holy and pure.

I received a call from Robert telling me that he had been let go by Bartzis.  
No reason was given. 
Outstanding pay was withheld. 
There was no severance.
This was one of a handful of paid positions that Bartzis had around him. 
The man running the whole show financially was David Dean Ellis,
a giant of a man, 
weighing in at around three hundred pounds and closer in height to seven than six feet tall.
All Bartzis's money went through a shell corporation in Barbados
&mdash;
a place Ellis called home until recently when he returned to Canada and settled in rural Saskatchewan
&mdash;
and there was a lot of money. 


Bartzis claimed he made $1,500 US dollars for a one hour reading and spiritual _session_ with a client. 
He claimed he had five clients a day,
five days a week. 
Do the math. 
It's just shy of $40,000 US dollars per week. 
Multiply it by fifty-four weeks and you've got Bartzis clocking in at over two million dollars per year. 
All of this for sitting in a room near Cleveland,
Ohio,
where he shares a house with his elderly parents,
and giving people _readings_,
no overhead but Robert Brown and Andrew's booking assistant,
Michelle.
And he didn't have back pay or severance for Robert?


It got worse. 
The day after being fired Robert woke up with a tremendous brain fog. 
I was informed by his wife, 
Monica. 
They lived in Columbia as North American emmigrants who left the United States, 
and they had a five-year-old daughter. 
It was around this time that I began to entertain a darker understanding of _the Great Bartzitzi_.
A few months later Robert died. 

He had a fast-acting brain tumor. 
This is the exact same disease and cycle that killed the only public love affair of Andrew Bartzis, 
a Woman by the name of Natalie,  
who was married to a very wealthy man at the time. 
Bartzis insinuated himself into their lives and the two pretended to the husband that Bartzis was gay.  
An affair ensued,
and after a short time Natalie became aware of what we'll just call the dark Side of Andrew Bsrtzis, 
the exact same thing I became aware of after I finished the book. 
Now don't get me wrong, 
we all have a dark side. 
But we don't all steal, 
lie, 
and murder. 
That's not integrating your shadow. 
That's not shadow work. 
That's fully committing to the dark side and expressing it. 
It's malignant narcissism and psychopathy. 
It's Andrew Bartzis.  

Did he kill his lover? 
If I were asked to testify before a cosmic tribunal I would say yes. 
Can I prove that? 
No. 
But we're not exactly talking about normal street crime here are we? 
We're in a much darker world. 
What makes this kind of darkness more repugnant is that you don't expect it to exist. 
You expect that somebody who could read the akashic records and who is as gifted as Andrew would transcend his dark side. 
Quite the opposite. 
He embraces it.


## David Ellis the Enforcer


When I last spoke with Robert's wife she was still fighting David Dean Ellis for back pay, 
having to resort to the bargaining position of not turning over external drives that contained all of the Bartzis material.  
Ellis was in charge of that negotiation. 

He's captured in some very compromising bedroom video with a man and a woman. 
I've spoken to people who claim they've seen pictures from the video, 
and they clearly show a naked Andrew Bartzis getting it on with a woman and a man. 
Always be suspicious of men around fifty or above who aren't married. 
The idea that they are sublimating their sexuality into some higher spiritual practice is a farce. 
Bartzis is run by his penis.
Masturbation is his favorite pastime after eating.


Bartzis has shown remarkable inconsistency on his sexual teachings over the last decade. 
I've spoken to people who have received readings from him and confessed to masturbating and they were told to give it up and they were doing great harm to themselves. After 2022 Bartzis seems to be much more comfortable talking about sexual self-gratification on his Zoom recordings. 
Maybe this was because he had compromising material on him. 
He does caution against pornography. 
And if we can assume that he heeds his own cautions, 
which is dubious given the documented character so far, 
we have to wonder aloud where he gets the psychic energy to masturbate multiple times a day?

Another favorite tactic of Ellis is to clone somebody's phone so that he's able to view all of their text exchanges. 
I've spoken to people who have been shown the text exchanges of colleagues of Ellis with their clients.  
Healers who thought they were operating under the umbrella of privacy without any knowledge that they had been hacked by David Dean Ellis. 
Now why Ellis would show these materials to third parties is anybody's guess. 
He's clearly breaking the rules of blackmail here. 
I guess he just can't help himself. 
Some systemic lack of discipline and malformation in his growth cycles as a human being.

Ellis claims gnosticism as a base of religious and spiritual expression. 
He's closely associated with a Martinist system of Gnostic knowledge transference in Barbados. 
Martinism is thinly veiled masonry, 
and masonry is thinly veiled Kabbalah, 
and while good results can come from any of these systems, 
usually we've seen very negative results in the last few generations. 
Ellis doesn't break that rule at all. 
He's a thug, 
a thief, 
an extortionist, 
and the principal at Universal Citizen Media (UCM),
a fledgling startup broadcast platform that features channeling and various forms of new age hocus pocus.






## The Temper Tantrum





## Andre Hodge

The most dangerous place to be is very close to the galactic historian. 
That's where people suffer the most. 
Before I came on the scene to write the book, 
there was another fellow who had been a colleague and confidant of Bartzis for a number of years. 
His name was Andre Hodge. 
He's an Australian fellow who continues on with his own YouTube channel now called _ServantOfTruth_.


Andre has become quite vocal on his YouTube channel about what he feels and what he perceives happened to him through his association with Andrew Bartzis. 
He makes no bones about it. 
Bartzis harvests energy from people around him. 
This can be done by competent psychics. 
And Bartzis is more than a competent psychic. 
Intelligence agencies use these kinds of people. 
Secret societies use these kinds of people. 
In a way, 
they're the perfect tool. 
When you start to talk about these things openly many people might think you're mentally imbalanced. 
After all, 
we live in an age of rationality. 
But when so many people are reporting the same thing, 
and when there are so many mysterious illnesses and deaths around one individual who, 
if these kinds of powers did exist, 
would certainly have them, 
we have to ask aloud whether it is the case.

I know from personal experience that Bartzis is very manipulative and has a naked cupidity that manifests as a kind of multi-dimensional kleptomania. 
All moral reasoning is vacated. 
There is a complete absence of ethics in Bartzis when he focuses on something in a covetous way.
And a partner like David Ellis just amplifies suspicion.


shame, consicence, ethics
