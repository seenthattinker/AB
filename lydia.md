Jeffrey Epstein's style. They're not friends. That's a leveraged relationship, but has him on video doing what? In, in his bedroom with a man and a woman. That's probably me and Chris. That's what that is. That's the videos. But I was having a relationship with Chris and Andrew said, okay, here's the deal and I have to, let me be clear about, I don't have any shame, blame of McGill.

I've never done anything like this before. Okay? But Andrew said, okay, except the fact that you two love each other, but y'all have blockages and I'm gonna help the two of you have a Kundalini, I'm gonna help y'all to awaken your Kundalini. So there was like, there was a threesome situation, but based on some type of spiritual thing that he promised, cuz he was still manipulating us.

Did you know, did you know that David filmed that, that there were cameras in the room? No, I didn't. But because it gets more deep, this is why I am very cautious of these people. You gotta listen to me. This is why I am cautious of these people. Bruce, listen up. Okay, so what it was, sorry, I'm my, I still have to charge with my phone.

Sorry. I really have to smoke in this process. Take, take your time. Breathe. Let me grab a coffee. Light your cigarette. Mm-hmm.

Okay. All right. So it was a thing. Now the blob was the one that said he wanted to film it. I've never been involved in anything like this, but I was really in love with Chris. I was single. I've always been in a relationship since I was 20. I had two long-term relationships, so it's like, you know, exploring.

And, um, it was a very, it was, it was a lot of actual incredible things and Chris and I, in all honesty, did end up both having our Kundalini awakening, but the blob was like, if I can't have you, I'm gonna puppeteer you. That was the whole energy. But the, but the fact is, in February, in fact, the, cuz Chris would come down and we would be together and the blob wanted to be a part of that energy.

Right. Okay. I said he wanted, cuz he was doing all these revocations and teaching us what to say and what to do to have the Kundalini awakening. And we both had it simultaneously and in fact, it was so intense when it happened in February of 2019 that, um, that, uh, when Chris left BBAs to go back to Connecticut.

Okay. He had to fly back to Barbados within two days because we hadn't like completed it. It was, I was not able to function. He wasn't able to function. I mean, he had like shooting energy coming out my crown, like, you know, on all types of different stuff going on. So I approached that on a very, very sacred, and Reverend Le, it wasn't like I, you know, never even was a fan of po It wasn't something it was on that premise.

Yeah. Okay. But he wanted to, and, and we took, I'd never done M D M A, I did M D M A with the blog the first time he introduced me to it in 2017. Right. I'd never done it. My ex did. So he gave me the M D M A, I'd never, ever done it in my life. And it was, we were, you know, we were all on that. Okay. So obviously you're a lot more open and we are using the equipment.

Like it was, it was pretty incredible for what it was. Now there comes in David. Now I had a pa, I had two PAs and they had the codes to everything of mine. Okay. So things break down and they said they were helping me with this. Like I had all my documents I own like personal document of my whole life, my kids, everything at the house.

Uh, afterwards decided we're splitting ways. Now fast forward to, I go to take my first vacation in May of 2019. I leave, I go away, I go away for two weeks with Chris. And in this time Andrew had packed up his whole house and Chris, I had stored all, cuz Chris is very wealthy. He has a huge four story house in Connecticut.

All the blob stuff was there. Okay? And, and Chris said, look, I will give you, I'll send Robert Brown flu to meet us in Connecticut. Robert and Blob had been there before. And we handed over like two to three trailers of stuff, U-haul stuff for Robert to then drive to wherever the hell Andrew wanted in it.

And I, I had a document and I said, I'm not gonna ask you, just give me back the Lucia, like, I have the emails. I gave them the nice way out, the most generous, peaceful way out. And they, they supposedly agreed to do that and signed the documents, send it back. We released all the things to Robert. Then I come back to Barbados.

It was May 29th cuz I extended one week cuz they begged me, they were planning this robbery. They said, yo, you should stay another week, dah, dah, dah. Take your time, everything is fine, don't worry, blah blah blah. Trying to make me feel all calm. And I walked into the house, I was renting. Everything was in my name here.

Everything was in my name cuz I was the only legal resident. We couldn't do anything, get a house, get anything unless my signature was on it. Bruce. And I trust, you know, I trusted them. And David had me sign a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo shit as well that he said was for the business. I'm going to take it international.

And I walk in every light and whole house is open, the gate is open in a remote location. And everything I owned was gone, including linens, paintings, all my documents. I mean, the, my, my, um, I'm not a citizen here, so my, my permanent residency document. Okay. Every and my, what hurt me, they built a big fire, burnt a bunch of my sacred objects, dumped my children's art.

I found my children's art, you know, in the garbage. I mean, my little son liked Andrew. They got home good cuz he was young at the time. He was just like 8, 9, 10, 7, 8, 9, 10 when all of this would've been going down because he's 14 now. So he was very little and he's young. I got, um, so I was freaked out, called the police had to deal with that.

They left me with all the paint. There was a court case, a very serious court case involved because it was a prime minister's brother who was a lawyer for the house. They tried to shaft us and we'd spent a lot of money and they left me with a court case, the fees. And they, but all the staff that were my friends, you see they had them on their side.

They all corroborated. But I have an eyewitness, I had an intuition. Uh, my AC guy, the guy that did the AC is a personal friend of mine and I said, look, I want you to drive by the house. You know, and he, when he pulled up that morning, he saw that they were packing up cuz they let him in thinking he was like a deliv cuz he was driving a van.

Mm-hmm. They thought he was wanting people picking up the stuff and he saw them packing up everything and then the blob came out. He is like, Hey Anthony, get the fuck outta here. We're busy or whatever. He's like, oh, I just came to check on the acs, you know, and he called me and that's when I tussled here the next day and found everything gone.

And, um, then, then I, then I found a document. I had to go through this huge house, three story plantation house on 3.5 acres in the middle of nowhere. And all the magical negative shit, my god, that he put in that property. I mean, he used to get terrorized, you know, I couldn't stay there. The police said, said it wasn't saved, but I found a document of where they were storing all the stuff and I knew the owner.

I said, this is the case. But they had all manipulated and got to them and they wouldn't let me access or whatever. Everywhere I went in law enforcement, et cetera, it was being blocked. Even my own lawyer, they got to, they manipulated her and she was in on it. Okay. So then, um, I found a document. So they must have realized, cuz if people that owned the storage place would've contacted them and said, look, she came here looking for the stuff, she knows it's here cuz I found this, this signature, the contract, the blobs signed to store the stuff there.

So I knew where all my stuff was cuz the stuff was in my name. Chris bought for me the equipment, it was not in the blobs name. And um, so they robbed me a second time. So in early June, cause I had to pack up everything. They robbed me a second time. And that's the first time in my life I actually experienced for the first time an actual panic attack where I couldn't move.

I had to go straight to the emergency room. Like I didn't know what was happening. So that was, that was Andrew and David. Okay. And all the staff people call Carla Chu, Jason Chu, my former best friend. Even, even my former best friend since I was 11, cuz she had stayed with us several times. We were really close and the blog was like making sexual advances on her because obviously I was now with Chris and you know, and having other women come and stay from overseas here, I didn't care, but, but she was the closest people to me.

He manipulated them. Like even somebody, like my closest friend. My sister and all this stuff. So what, it was a whole thing. Tell me about, then, just briefly circle back to his hygiene. I mean, does he shower, does he wash, does he use deodorant? This, this man would get up when we, when he first lived with me, that's when I freaked out.

I said, I cannot live with you. This man would, he has the condition. So he bleeds. He bleeds from his ass. Literally bleeds, you know, like sores in his ass and all his private parts and everything. Oh, you gotta come in the toilet. No, you go in the bathroom and find his pants, his underwear with shit and blood all over them scratching like a maniac and skin of food, blood, blood on the couch, skin everywhere, like, I mean, and not dressing properly.

And then he had a, the condition where you have this really bad smell like athlete's foot. Okay. And I would say, look, you need to soap wipe the bottom of your feet with vinegar. He used to wear these big clunky boots and he would smell like honestly a rotten bologna sandwich. He would just smell like a heat of like festering garbage and just disgusting.

His hygiene was disgusting. Yes. I think I know he had a lot of issues and the irony is anytime we tried to get natural products for his skin, he would go insane when he would use anything organic and he would have silent rages and be like, fuck all this organic shit. The only thing that he said worked for his skin was Vaseline.

What is the condition? What is the medical name? Okay. Which is, he says it's an autoimmune disease that causes, it's some type of autoimmune disease, but like it has to do something with his gut as well because. Anytime he ate something like sauerkraut or any healthy probiotics, he would have the most adverse, uh, reactions.

His diet is the, is terrible, you know, and I tried, he lost a lot of weight initially when he was with me, like a lot of weight. And then he just put it all back on. Um, anyway, so come fast forward now to the August of 2019. I went to, with my son was witness to this, uh, I with, I was with my son, went to go and get his food and drink at a local place.

They were, he was still on island. And I went in a, in a open car park. My son saw it. One of my former staff who had, who was, they were running the system that they had stole it. Carla, I saw her and I said, Carla, let me tell you something. God is gonna deal with you. That God is going to deal with you for what you've done.

You cannot do this to me. I, my family know how good I've been to all these people. Like I was really good to them, my family and friends. So no, I said that to her. The next day I get this email, my email account is l lydia gmail.com. That's my personal, but what they did is they had all my passwords to everything I own.

So they were manipulating stuff. Yeah, but I had managed to deal with that. What happened was they sent an email from account saying, l lydia mail.com. I have it. And it says, um, if you behave yourself, and they sent me the first porno video of me, you know, and all this. And they sent the second one. Now what they did, that same day I was about to travel to Connecticut.

It was like August 16th, I believe, of 2019. My ex has a large construction firm and a woodworking factory. Okay. What did they do, Bruce? They sent to my ex and his entire office staff all the videos of me having sex with my ex and the blob there in the background. Are you getting me and said that if I proceeded, they're gonna send it to my children's school schools?

Why? Why did they turn on you in this way? Well, isn't that obvious to you by now? Yes. But I need you to say it. I'm a journalist. We're not friends talking here. Okay. And my, I can never really truly know because I am not them. Okay. But I believe from, from what I'm seeing is that, first of all, David wanted me out the way and I had all the evidence of all they did.

I had the actual evidence, alright? I had to, I had the evidence. And also when it came to the blog, he told me he wa he was, he was convinced we were gonna ha he wanted children from me as he wanted to have a child. His mother came and stayed with us, and guess what? Even, even when his mother came silently, she pulled me aside and she said, listen, I think that my son is a con artist.

I really appreciate you being kind to him, but do not believe anything he says. He's a pathological liar. She his own mother. She had the same conversation with me halfway through the book. Wow. Yeah. His brothers don't believe hi. His, his, uh, his, his, his reputation and his family is horrible, horrible. He hates them.

He was always, you know, uh, trying to play on that. But let me just, um, I just have to, I have to, Do a peepee. Okay. And I'll be right back. One second. Alright. Yeah.

So to go back to it, there was two things he told me. I had a particular type of DNA n. That in which he wanted to have children with this is what was in, he wanted to have a child with me because of my DNA that he wanted to have that d And um, also, there was one strange thing. There was one strange thing, um, that basically he, there was a practice he would make me do for months and it was like torture.

He used, fuck off. Sorry.

Your, your camera is gone.

Welcome back.

Sorry about that. That's all right. Yeah. Great. So the other thing that he said, but she was very insistent upon where he would, we would be work a whole day. Of course, I didn't know he was on substances, so I didn't understand where he was getting all his energy from. But I'm not a late night person. Okay.

And so he used to tell me that I would have to enter a shamanic state. After a long day in the heat working all day at business, he would keep me up. And his intention, he said that I came from a very specific collective, an angelic collective. Part of me is called this Kill Corner Collective. And that he wanted me to make contact with them because he wanted to speak to them or have some type of association to them.

I asked him what was so special about this Kill Corner collective, and he said they were the only beings he's aware of that have seen, seen all of the universe, that they've, I don't know what sort of extended vision they may have. They basically, how he described it as they have seen, um, like more than this universe or there was something information there, uh, he was not able to access it.

So he wanted me to access it. There were a couple of times where I could see the, I could see the angelic forms starting to, you know, sort of, they come like waves in the reality, get, the reality gets wavy. But some obviously my higher self, it couldn't hold. It didn't hold. And he used to get really angry and get really mean.

When it is, I couldn't make the link. Meanwhile, I was dropping to sleep, like till 4:00 AM in the morning and you have to work the next thing. And this used to happen cyclically. Yeah. Okay. What else can you add? Is there anything else that comes to mind? I think we've pretty much covered everything. Um, in, in the moment just about his former C E O I'm pretty convinced he killed her, um, because she was gonna, for him, she would tell me about that.

She, they had a ceremony. And like, and I started to see the evilness. Like there were certain times I would look at him and this look would come outta his eyes and it would scare the life outta me. And she basically found out who he was. And she, cuz he told me this when he was high and she was going to expose him, and he said that that was the universe, like trying to deal with her because she was gonna lie on him.

But I believe that he, she basically think was gonna expose him for being a, you know, involved in some sort of negative, uh, whether it's extraterrestrial factions, you know? Okay.

Right. So I'm gonna, um, so she, she caught onto him and realized he was evil and was going to expose him? Yes. Yes. Okay. And how long after did she, did she communicate that to you? Actually he did. Well, he'd put it in a different light. She, he said that she said she, she, he told me the truth, but he told me it to me like in a distorted way.

He told me like, um, you know, she had lost her mind and thought he was evil and was going public to tell people he was this evil person. And he was so sad that she died. But obviously that was like the universe protecting him or something to that effect. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

You've told me a lot of secrets today, okay? Okay. Okay. From the moment we met, Andrew has been on eggshells around me, and he is terrified of me. I don't know why. I don't know why, right? Yes. I don't know why. Um, but, uh, it's almost like from the moment we met, he, he, he saw the foreshadowing of his demise.

Now on October 29th of last year, he, he did a very conscious attack upon my son and I. We turned it back on him right away, like right away. So, um, right, it, it, it bounced back. Um, I. Uh, I, I am, I am, let's just say commissioned to do this. So now that doesn't mean that I can guarantee protection for everyone who participates, but I think you're going to be okay because I think he's gonna have a lot of energy taken out of him very quickly.

He's gonna have a, like a panic attack moment. This is not just one person, the guy he wrote the book with. I've now spoken to everybody. Andre Amir. Um, I'm waiting to hear from, there's a story about a psychic rape he committed in Washington State 10 years ago when the girl was 15. I'm waiting to, uh, I'm waiting to hear from that, from that person.

So, um, and then when I get that story, I'm just gonna finish it all up and write it up. I mean, it's already about 5,000 words. It's a very long magazine piece. Um, now the readings I've gotten from people is that, uh, he's, he's very much like, uh, Marlon Brando at the end of Apocalypse Now. He knows it's his time and he, he, he almost, he wants to go out this way in some way.

He like, he, he knows it's his time. And I'll tell you a little bit else, okay, so the fellow, the fellow he fucked with, which, which was probably his mistake, was John Edmonds. John Edmonds was a first generation super soldier. He had connections like you can imagine c i a m i six. You, you cannot imagine.

Okay? And I've spoken to some of these people after I began to. Concentrate my convictions into reality that he did this. And, um, so there's some very powerful people working on this. Now, this is generally what I've heard back from these people. They said there was one lady, she's Scottish, she's in her seventies, she's an m i six subcontractor.

She deals with the nastiest forms of psychic problems that the, um, that the British government might have to deal with, okay? Mm-hmm. This is, this is how she started the conversation. She said, Bruce, the first clue that somebody is not that powerful is they go public. And I said, well, that's interesting, why?

And she said, because if you truly were the psychic that this man is claiming to be, you would never go public. It's too dangerous. Okay? She said, she, she said he is about 10% of what he claims to be. And, um, just a, a generally nasty human being. Now, this conversation I had with her was four or five months ago, and I believe in the background psychically.

She set up this situation because as soon as I said, is it time to write it? Her, her image came to my consciousness and said, yeah, the path is cleared. You won't be touched. Go ahead. So it's, it's just so, and this, this woman asked me when I was on the call with her, she asked me for pictures of everybody.

So I gave her at this, at this point, AME Amir hadn't left the group. So I gave Andrew's picture, uh, David Ellis's picture, and I gave Amir's picture. Amir contacted me 30 minutes after my, my, my Skype call with Irene and detailed what happened to him, and she was literally in his head for 20 minutes and it was an interrogation.

Okay? So she went and did that to David and to Andrew. And said, okay, you guys have had a real nice run here. You've been playing for a couple decades. It's over. It's over. You crossed this line when you killed John Edmonds. John Edmonds was protected. He had a role to fulfill whatever it was you, greed, because you wanted to get in on the TV series or when, when any It's all I I in, in the piece I'm writing so far, I describe Bartz as a multi-dimensional kleptomaniac, so he'll see good, he'll see good fortune coming in your timeline.

He'll get really close to you waiting and then he wants to steal it. So he asked to meet the TV producer, and he did, he did a three hour healing with her on Skype. And after that healing, I had no more direct communication with her. That was his way of making sure if a TV series got done, he was on the writing team.

And it was then I realized, okay, this guy is just a piece of fuck and shit. Like, you know, and, and, and so I've, but I was gonna let it go even, even after Robert Brown was killed. I was gonna let it go. Even after the psychic attack by, um, Andrew on October 29th. I was going to let it go. Right? But it was when Amir left that I said, okay, enough is enough.

I'm going to write this now. So, um, thank you for your time and, um, okay. But it's very important for me to understand not everything, like I don't, I don't mind sharing with you, Bruce, my brother. And this journey. Okay. Ele, I will give you a draft of the story and I'll give you editors. Nothing will go public until you sign off on it.

I give you my word. Okay. Thank you. Okay. And then the other important question that came to me was, um, why do you think, because I Why do you think that the Cyclops has something on him by having those videos? I can't, I, nothing comes to mind. Okay. Okay. I think I know that Cylo, I think so. I mean, the Cyclops, so the, the, the Paul, the Paul Makis, the, the Australian couple in, um, in, uh, in Perth.

I believe they, they worked with U C M for a while and um mm-hmm. I, I don't know what it is with David, but he's got no discretion. So David cloned, Melissa Hawking, Hughes's telephone. And was was sharing text message exchanges that she had with clients of hers. She's a healer. She, the cyclops was sharing these things with, um, with, um, the Pawelski, also Irene, the m i six contractor, she, she told me, uh, the most dangerous of the three is David.

Yes. I would, if you have contact with her, she needs to look into Sean Bond because as I told Amir, he's a, like a backup battery that nobody knows about and he has to be dismantled. In order for this to be successful, I am promising you that, okay, I can't do anything about 'em now I'm gonna concentrate on and the blob.

Okay. Got you. Yeah. Thank you very much, Lydia. Thank you. Bye.
