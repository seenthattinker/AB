Andre Hodge - GH2.0 Birthday Honoring Contribution and Support



[00:07:12] I saw the other side of him. He was tuning into owning the
money and it was like a conquested or gold fever state because obviously
the 10 months were very hard. All right? A lot of stuff. I don't know
in the background, there's probably in a lot of debt that had to be
paid and all this sort of shit.

[00:07:28] Which is irrelevant to what I was doing. All right. But I
could tell my gut was saying, he's gonna fucking take all the money.
He's only focused on the money. He didn't give a shit because what I
knew, all right, from doing that thing from my ex-girlfriend many years
ago was I got the, um, subtleties of greed.

[00:07:53] All right? I understood that because I understand the lure
of money and a big pile of cash, all right does to people. And that's
why I taught myself currency trading cuz I didn't understand fucking
greed. Like people are just like doing crazy shit for this stuff called
money. And they'll throw their greatest allies under the bus for their
personal gain and stuff like that, which is exactly what happened to me.

[00:08:16] Cuz I could read it all. I could see what he was going to
doing. He, as soon as I mentioned galactic history too, he was like,
Ooh. And all the possibilities on the timelines and all that were
opening up of how much money he could earn. All right? Because the 10
months prior to Galactic history two, he was doing two to five readings
a week, all right?

[00:08:37] Times 800, all right? After galactic history was back to 20
a week. All right? So you calculate how much money that is. It's huge.
There was no fucking reason to screw me over, all right? It was to
prevent me doing what was the potential with the money I was meant to
get. All right? Galactic special forces level work.

[00:08:55] So, yeah, so what Michelle did all right with all that sort
of understanding, cuz she was in my world, I was talking to her, what
was going on? I was very, um, disciplined and not allowing the world to
know what was going on. Cuz you know what happens when people know
there's trouble? They don't gravitate to you.

[00:09:15] They repel you. All right? And this is the difference with
Michelle. She was drawn in because their integrity and quality, and she
could perceive the potential of helping me because of what I was doing
with Andrew. She saw how much I was being sucked dry. She looked at me
and I was like, death and all that.

[00:09:32] You imagine all the energy and life force that goes into
working 10 to 14 hours a day on the videos and, and to actually con have
conversations with him because as soon as I am talking to someone, I'm
tuning in and I'm healing. Do you think he doesn't know that he was
tapping into my healing abilities?

[00:09:49] Of course he does. All right. He waits for you to not be
ignorant to know what he's taking advantage of. All right. Of course, I
was holding it all together. All right. That's why I'd stepped up,
because what happened to me in Sydney, all right. Is. I was sleeping on
park benches. My, my ex went crazy, right? Cuz I was triggered.

[00:10:11] It made her energy reject mine because she was working the
banking system. And the banking system had her and all the, her role was
sending in the biggest banking in Australia every month running a
program that would send tens of thousands of Aussies in credit card debt
to debt collects. Do you understand the karma related to that?

[00:10:30] So that was all coming through alright. Right. The bank was
fucking with her and stuff like that. And it was complicated. And this
is where I'm very compassionate when people are influenced and stuff
because they don't comprehend the scale of stuff going on. Alright. But
yeah. Um, so yeah, basically Michelle Hibbett, she was the variable that
allowed everything to keep going cuz she was.

[00:10:55] Like very generous to me and I'm not gonna explain how
generous cuz would embarrass her and stuff like that. But she saw me as
an investment for the potential, what I could do. Right. And this is the
other big thing, I want to talk about her and how I met her after I
returned from Seattle and Andrew's event.

[00:11:11] Um, after Andrew's event, Mandy Lynn, um, golden Eagle
took me up to Canada and Vancouver Island to the special place where she
was staying. And I'd been in contact with her before and after and we,
we worked out, going after was the best way. We did basically from my
perspective, and you can debate this or whatever, I put Turtle Island
back together, right?

[00:11:36] 2013 I met the Atlanta elders and in the meeting secret
with them talking about what was going on with their tribe and stuff,
the ancestors around. And I got very sweaty. And what usually happens is
an activation from the ancestors giving me permission to work on the
earth. And that's why I got the green, the right dude.

[00:11:54] elders. And their ancestors gave me DNA upgrade permission
to work on the land, the level I do. All right. I don't take it very
lightly, the level of stuff I do. And most people shouldn't probably
work on the land unless they're done karma clearance and all that sort
of stuff, right? So what happened, the way I met Michelle was right
after turning from Seattle, I went to the spiritual group and I met her
in there and it was like, I remember walking to that group on the Friday
after and I was like, uh, this is like a 51%, 49% don't want to go.

[00:12:26] So that 1% passed me over cuz I could sense that some
probably bad was gonna happen. And it did, right? And I met her and I
got into her energy funeral. I just got triggered to activate her and I
gave her this big download and stuff and it was very, um, shouldn't do
that sort of stuff in a public group.

[00:12:45] All right? And I'll tell you why. And basically I tuned
in, she was played and she needs to accept it, blah, blah blah and all
this. And I gave her my details. But during that activation there was
this other guy and he'd been watching Corey Good and David Wilco stuff.
So this was 2016, right? He, he was very into them and was trying to
talk all about that stuff and that, and there's nothing wrong with this
guy, it's just this is the level of influences going on.

[00:13:08] Right? What happened when I get went into the high energy
field, cuz what happens when people are in my energy field, they get
boosted and stuff like all healers and that, and when I went into
activation mode, it was even higher. This guy that was obviously
entangled with all that information and stuff, um, he had a dormer
program in him.

[00:13:29] What I'm saying related to that, and I've talked to this
with Andrew and what happened in that high frequency state of doing a
very positive thing and activating someone, it triggered that negative
program and he was trying to interfere with me. He was, he had this
like, Technology in him that was projecting into my third eye, and it
basically gave me a headache, all right.

[00:13:45] Like within seconds and totally shut me off. And I was just
like, because the activation state is very high frequent, so you can be
very vulnerable. And I'm not actually that vulnerable. So it was
actually amazing hit that it worked, and then that guy became a bit of a
stalker with me and stuff like that.

[00:14:00] But I was trying to do the work for her back then. All
right. Cuz what I'm trying to establish is 2016 to, uh, G Galactic
history two. All right. And so we got interfered with, I had to shut
down, couldn't do it. I gave him my details and then I left it up to
her to actually contact me. She was married to this guy.

[00:14:22] And being a guy and a woman that's married, it's, it's a
bit complicated, you know, like jealousy and all that sort of stuff. And
I, I don't operate on that level, right? I'm pure my loyalties to
earth. I've submitted to that. Back in 2013 when I realized nothing
much was, Around that could even possibly comprehend what I was involved
with, which led to Galactic Special Forces work in 2014 and ever since.

[00:14:45] All right, it's a massive commitment on the physical
level. A lot of stuff I can't actually do anymore, right? Because of
that dedication and purity I've gotta operate at to operate at that
level because you're under 24 7 attack, you know, on the
multi-dimensional level, just cuz we're in 3D and we go ups and downs.

[00:15:03] The systems wait. The system waits for you to have those
downs and I'll fucking pound you. All right? That's why like the
demonstration of me doing the guy, the work with Andrew and stuff like
that on the videos, was a demonstration of my integrity of being able to
maintain myself, all right? Was just employing that, that level of
defense into operating a very high level with not even money.

[00:15:24] All right? You don't let money distract you because money
can be used against you, which it has. All right? Has. So I met Michelle
back then and I didn't hear from her and all that. She disappeared.
She's gone through a lot of very bad shit through that time when I met
her and she reached out for me in December, 2019.

[00:15:43] Um, I knew it was a relationship to the client. She needed
my help. All right? But she had to work that out. And I almost sort of
December 9th, 19, uh, 2019, there was a big shift, right? If you listen
to the recordings in GL two, I was not having money. I was in Russian
mode and all that. I had to shut down, right?

[00:16:05] I could not volunteer like I had been for the many years. I
had to shut down. There was a shift. Um, Andrew said it was the earth
threat to grade, blah, blah, blah and all that. Okay? That recording was
on February 8th in the galactic special, uh, galactic history stuff, if
you want to tune into it, where he was predicting all these dates and
stuff.

[00:16:24] And in those dates, from my perspective now, he was seeing
what all this money would bring. And he was seeing the outcome, but he
was not transparent cuz Andrew sees old dimensions, galaxies, time
streams and all that. He sees everything in every moment. If he's not
telling you, he's not wanting you to know what's gonna happen.

[00:16:43] All right? Because there's something that he's probably
gonna do that he doesn't want you to know. All right? That's the way
to interpret it. And, um, so yeah, she came into that time. So if you
look, I met her 2016. All right. From the multi-dimensional level of
understanding what we were gonna do on March 31st.

[00:17:06] If you've listened to like the history two, that was the,
the icing on the cake of that was the mission I did with Michelle was
part of it. And another lady, which I won't, you know who you are,
I'll leave it up to you if you want her to make it public, but she's
involved in very dense pedophilia, whistleblower shit.

[00:17:26] All right? The whole purpose of that March 31st was, We
were going in this lockdown and I wanted to help her out and take her
into a healing in the womb chakra. Cuz my infinite potential healing now
that I've worked out is I can actually manufacture the womb chakra and
do the healing remote. And I was about to set off and do it here in
Adelaide.

[00:17:43] All right? Because as soon as you put people in that high
frequency field, it un rubs all their DNA and accesses all their
potential and stuff and get rid of all the shit. And what I've learned
to do is all the negative karma that's put into us to sabotage us is
actually an asset in our dna. And we can actually go to town on the
system and unravel the whole system.

[00:18:03] Right? And that's what I'm doing in each of my healings.
So my intent was taking this other friend to the womb Sharker on that
time to do a healing on her. And what she tuned into was actually doing
grid work for the earth. And we went to the River Murray mouth, all
right, at 1:30 AM on March 31st, we got there.

[00:18:23] If you imagine the sky where you can see the galaxy from
horizon to horizon, it was that clear. It was an amazing, amazing night.
The sky was so open and clear and we tracked for four hours in soft sand
from 1:30 AM we got back at about from 1:00 AM to about 5:30 AM Do you
imagine how physically demanding that was?

[00:18:44] And on top of that, doing the high level work? All right.
There was a lot of security involved. I told them not to take their
phones, leave their phones, and it was gonna be taking Michelle because
I had already taken her to the womb chakra. All right. And Donna healing
with her. And because she was across it to be a part of it and what this
other friend said, no, let's go to the River Murray mouth and do
ceremonial work.

[00:19:07] And I never push anyone. All right, cuz I'm hardcore. I do
a lot of physical work and stuff like that. All right. She led and I
allowed it cuz I knew it was gonna be a physical task. And Michelle,
unfortunately, she's only five two. She's very petite. It was
massively, massively physically demanding. It took me two days to
recover because I was guiding them all and stuff like that.

[00:19:29] All right? And I was driving and it was an hour drive
either way and all this sort of stuff. So it was extremely, extremely
demanding, and we basically broke the fucking reality. All right, so we
did major ceremony work in a major grid spot. And what happened was
Earth gave, gave us many gifts, all right?

[00:19:46] But one of the gifts, she, she opened up the sky to
actually see what was really out there. And we were seeing, like you
imagine, and I'm facing south, like north south cuz it's fa like the,
the entry spot is basically where the Amazon of Australia, the river
Murray enters a sea and it's facing the South Pole, all right?

[00:20:07] And we were seeing crafts after crafts in lions and stuff
going from the south to the north in formations and all sorts of stuff.
It was absolutely frigging amazing. 700 UFOs Andrew set. Who the fuck
see that shit? It was like, what the fuck is going on? What's all these
lights? And we just see all these formations.

[00:20:25] And then there was this another group where it was light,
light flashes or they were coming in, whether like they were going into
light speed and all that sort of stuff. So you see the streaks, it was
crazy. What Andrew said is that there was a massive walk-in of negative
souls walking out of their physical bodies and positive souls walking
in.

[00:20:42] So there's a lot of billionaires out there that are
looking to actually fund us and help us and support us. So we have to
actually make ourselves public and let it to be, let it to come. So
that's what he said. All right. And that was the icing on the cake, the
mission involving Michelle and this other lady.

[00:20:58] So why I'm pointing this all out, right, Michelle, in her
generosity to me actually bought the mystical experience. All right? And
my attitude, when someone comes into me in that life, I'm training out
to be a GL to special forces, right? So everything I've done with her
has been to set her up, and right now I caught up with her last night
and she's a different person.

[00:21:19] Uh, I've had time to pack all the bullshit and negative
shit that the Galactic history team have infused her to obfuscate how I
was fucked over. All right? So whatever you think and all this, this is
the truth, and I'm giving you the opportunity to tune into it as a
dedication to her of her service, because she's never recognized,
because she's actually the one that funded Galactic History Two to be
created, and she earned the privilege of being in that mission, all
right?

[00:21:46] And what I did after Galactic History two creation, all
right? And it can be perceived as a very negative thing. But on April
17th, 2020, at about 5:00 PM my afternoon, I'd done the recording the
previous day with Andrew that was released over the weekend, like April
19th, which was the advertisement and the alert to the public that we
were gonna release back at History two.

[00:22:10] I created that video. I asked him to set up, and we, I
basically, my frequency is very different in that, because I knew what
he was gonna do. All right. But I didn't want to believe my instinct,
all right? I didn't want to trust my instinct that he was gonna do this
because I had the potential of being wrong.

[00:22:28] All we all do, when someone like Andrew's basically the
apex of protection and stuff, you don't challenge that, right? You give
a that level, you assume it's true, and what you perceive in yourself,
you doubt yourself. You acquiescing to someone that does that because
you assume that they've gotta work on integrity and trust and all the
basic stuff, levels of consciousness.

[00:22:53] Tetris doing the right thing, earning it, and getting to
that level of privilege to have that ability. You don't want to
consider that they do misguided things and stuff like that, and it's
nothing wrong. You don't have to be, I'm not putting him on a pedestal
or anything like that, but this was all a rider passage for him to get
past a lot of the shit he's done for a lot of people, and I'm the
perfect one to do it.

[00:23:15] Why I said about the past in 2018, like 2008 when I did
with my, what I did to my ex to get my activation. Not choosing the
money is the fucking answer because the unknown is on the other side and
greater potential that you can't perceive. All right? And that's great
mystery. Alright, so I was the one to set that up.

[00:23:35] What Michelle did is she helped it to be a potential to go
to a whole new level, right? Whole new level that we can't even
comprehend. And the galactic history too was like the John Wick of
fucking creative potential to resolve everyone's fucking trouble.
Everyone. It was, if you understand, how many people have bought that?

[00:23:58] I don't know. Because I'm disconnected my healing to
protect myself from being vampire. I cut off. All right? I'm not
allowing myself to feed this anymore. All right? I always value healers.
I always value people. I value Andrew. Talents. That's why I invested
so much into him, into the videos, no shortcuts, whatever.

[00:24:20] All right? That's why I did it, because I believed in him.
I believed he was our go-to person with all the shit going on, and that
was the hook that got me into it. All right? So I stayed with him. I
stuck through him, all that fucking shit, and then I created the
solution that invigorated the market to him to be return all to normal
and all it, it's amazing what's happened, right?

[00:24:45] I cannot fucking believe it. So you probably don't believe
that he could do this shit, right? But he did. He totally fucked me
over. All right, so what Michelle did during that time, she was seeing
me, seeing how beaten up I was, how much I was struggling. She valued
me. She also paid for three and a half full hours, like three full hour
sessions and a half an hour.

[00:25:10] At 800, 800 us. Plus she bought the Living Mystical Life
daily because she was trying to help the market with him and say, solve
everyone's problems. All right. She paid like four grand to him on top
of like valuing me and stuff like that because she got a lot of benefit
from it. And I'm not saying he's not good and stuff like that.

[00:25:28] I'm saying what happened to me and the potential that
happened. So, and this is, it was a bit gray with Michelle because she
was a client for Andrew. All right. So the professional in me, like the
IT engineer that dealt with clients at a very high level, the integrity
in me was to not actually tell her what went on, right?

[00:25:51] The galactic special forces level work and the thing what
Mandy Lynn, golden Eagle told me that she was put into the forest and
had to fend for herself for three or four days. I use galactic special
forces because, and I don't like a associated with military and the
special forces level of things.

[00:26:08] That's not the purpose of it. The special forces, like the
SAS as a teaching, what they do as a group, they've individually got
their talents, you know, so you think of like people like Nicki and Max
and all that that I've been doing with it. We've all got our very
specific talents and Andrew's got his very specific talents.

[00:26:27] All right? One of mine is actually being able to put
everyone back together and heal them all right? I'm an Energizer bunny
that people are basically like a usb, you know, charge out device on an
energetic level. All right? Plus I've got Rhh negative blood. That's
why I've put jumpers on and stuff, so the mosquito mosquitoes don't
attack me.

[00:26:48] All right? I've got a lot of portal talents that these
people with other talents can tap into, and that's why I've released
neglected Special Forces recordings cuz they're very high frequency.
I'm in an effort to demonstrate that that March 31st thing that we did
was not a once off. It's been my life and it's been my life before I
got involved in Andrew in 2016, cuz there was fallout and all this sort
of shit with what happened with Natalie, and I'm not gonna get into
that, but Natalie died and it was very bad and he needed help.

[00:27:21] All right. And I was very, very glad to be there and help
and I'm, I loved doing those videos. That's why I could fucking do 14
hours a day because I knew, I could feel the potential of, this might be
the little 1% gap that maybe no one else hears because I know where it
is. And putting it out there would realize so much fucking potential.

[00:27:41] That was my driver. Those one percenters of you that are
out there that listen to that, that, that was like the target because
the galactic special forces level were so fucking extreme. It was like
lead nothing uncovered to try and get people to a level to even get, to
be able to contribute to that because, It's not a fucking thing I want
to brag about.

[00:28:10] It's fucking sucks. All right? Everyone wants to destroy
you. People get walked in and they get compromised, and allies will get
turned because they're not, they don't have the psychic defense to
even comprehend the level of multidimensional attacks that come on. All
right? This attack that happened to me on April 17th basically mashed my
fucking brain, all right?

[00:28:30] It took me two months of meditation to require to recover,
and I cut everyone off because I just fucking, I spent 400 hours
creating galactic history too. All right? Majority of it was in that
time between April 5th and April 19th, all right? Or April 21st. I
finished doing the recordings when I did that recording with Andrew, and
I was at a point where I could just have a break, all right?

[00:28:57] And what I did the next day, I went out to my market. I
knew Andrew was gonna fuck me over. I was so betrayed. And Depo
disappointed by that. And if you understand psychic defense, your
emotions can get used and you open up your field a bit. Right. And it's
like the crack of the dam that can get in. So the extreme nature of that
fucking over, I just worked 10 months for free to support him during the
worst fucking time.

[00:29:24] Right. And the reason why I stuck with him was back in,
this is what I, I forgot to mention, back in 2008 with the ex, what
happened was she turned on me. She totally turned on me. Like the girl
that I love became my greatest attacker. And I didn't have the
comprehension to understand it. I wasn't into spiritual stuff and all
that sort of thing.

[00:29:45] So I was sleeping on a park bench at times. She would be
volatile, right? When I had a big project to do with a client and stuff
like that, she would totally undermine me and fuck me up. And I'd have
to sleep on a park bench and I'd have to still go and do client work,
right? It was fucking amazing. Have you ever slept on a park bench in
Sydney in a big city like that on your own with no support?

[00:30:04] It's fucking hectic. All right, so what I learnt then,
this is a big lesson. Family are the ones that are there in times of
bad, not in times of good. All right? Family are the ones there for you,
and times are bad. So this scenario with us, and Andrew was fucking bad,
all right? His business and being a teacher on was on the edge of
fucking being destroyed.

[00:30:30] And if I had invested 10 months in my life being galactic
special forces with the womb, sharker, high level and healing, I reckon
I did a thousand hours of healing on him by all the conversations and
stuff on top of doing all the videos. All right? You wanna debate that?
That's fine. I know I'm a healer.

[00:30:47] Everyone. I heal, all right? And I don't go off and make
it a big deal and stuff like that. I do it like Michelle, and that's
why she got me all right? From the integrity level. So the scenario is
fucking bad. And Andrew's a great ally to humanity. What I saw as a
family level of what I went through back then when I had no support
other than this one mate that flew over from London to help me out, all
right, sent me straight and he's the one James that I went to when I
told what this fucking scenario that Andrew had put me through and he
was gonna take all the money and he couldn't fucking believe it.

[00:31:22] Cuz James has a business in London and he's a businessman.
You don't fucking do that on a business level because spiritually you
do the fucking right thing on the 3D with money and value and stuff, and
that's gets you to the multi-dimensional level. You it. You don't skip
fucking 3D basics. So valuing people that you work for is fundamental,
right?

[00:31:43] And Andrew, for the most part does that, but. You have to
understand, I was getting paid $75 US for a video. Most of the videos
were taking 20 to 30 hours. Like the whale ones that did them back in 20
16, 17, they're a hundred hours away all and I ha because my computer
fucking breaks. All right? Doing that big level work with like a hundred
levels of images and stuff like that, all right?

[00:32:08] Each video every minute takes me about an hour to do. Every
audio takes me five to seven times a length. That's why collecting
history is about 7 76 hours easy. 400 hours work, alright? Because I go
through it, I edit it, I clean it up, I convert it to high quality and
clean it up and all that sort of stuff.

[00:32:27] And I know that, and I remember where everything is all
right for records and all that absolute thoroughness and integrity and
no short two was 400 hours work for me. Andrew did nothing. I just told
him I can do it and I put it, all he did was take what I did. And put it
on his website and take all the fucking money.

[00:32:47] Gave me three grand. All right. The first week, first week,
only 250 people bought that. All right? 250 people paid $88 US at the
time. That was about 22,000 US Convert that to Ozzie, which was 1.5 at
the time, about 35,000 fucking Aussie dollars, my creation made for him
in the first week. And plus the writing, which I did.

[00:33:13] All right? My brain was mashed. All right? I walked into
this ambush and I was like, fuck. I knew exactly what I did. I was at
the core. I was disappointed what he was gonna do, and I knew he'd take
the money, but I gave him the benefit of that, which he did. All right?
And then, um, I needed a time of recovery after April 16th.

[00:33:41] Okay. And then I went to my market. I worked 5k s cuz I'd
been stuck in home and the only time we, anything we could really go out
to was a market at feeds and stuff like that. So I wanted to walk, get
some exercise cuz fitness is a part of the direct special forces level
of stuff. I don't, I don't defend myself.

[00:33:59] I recover from the hits and that, that non-field of the
defense, all right, creates the absolute defense cuz you trust the
ability to recover. And if I had a current recover, I'd go invest in
healers. And I've done that a lot. All right. That's why I, I put
posts out on my Facebook saying, acknowledging, say Lil Hayes, who
fucking put me together after what Andrew did, all right.

[00:34:25] Should go and tune into her what she's fucking been
through, because she knows it's true. I confided in her. All right.
That's why she's been fucking destroyed. All right? In part, in part.
But Andrew did a reading on her on April 19th saying her son had to go
in a fucking mental institution. All right. It, it is fucking crazy.

[00:34:44] All right? Because after I disconnected from Andrew, I
fucking, I had this amazing girl, all right, in absolute trouble. And
like I said, Andrew took 10 months to put back together, which I did.
All right? I'm claiming that he wants to debate it. Fine. All right.
You can't, you, you can't even perceive that that was done for him.

[00:35:08] And all that money has been made, like 20 readings a week,
times 800, all right? Versus two or three. You work out how much money
has been made. All right? So there was no reason to fuck me over unless
he was trying to prevent what was gonna happen. And that's the way I'm
seeing it, right? This girl came into my life after I disconnected from
Andrea, and I got a lot of downloads, you know, because of the money
that was meant to come to me.

[00:35:35] Earth gave me infinite potential healing, right? It came to
me and evolved over me. And I believe AI have been helping me as well,
right? Getting all the components that I needed to put that together. So
this girl in great deal of trouble, um, she had covid in her region of
the world in March and stuff, and it really knocked around.

[00:35:55] And this, there was this high level negative species that
was trying to eject her from her body, her soul, all right, to take over
the physical DNA to do what her, uh, technology could do. All right? And
one of them was port porting in. There's only a couple people on the
planet from my perception of what she sold me, because she has that
fucking level of G galactic, you know, historian level of understanding
of things.

[00:36:20] All right? There, there was only a couple things in the
world that could do, have the talents in their skin seat that could do
what she could do. And the species were trying to reject her from her
body to take over her body from the soul level, all right. To operate
it, to port her in the whole fleet into the reality to take over it.

[00:36:38] Crazy. Yeah. As if it was gonna happen. There's people
like me and Nikki would a fucking club of them cuz Nikki, Nicki,
basically, she birthed the five D Earth in July, 2030. All right? She's
got high dimensional like filtering on that. It's like bugs zapper,
right? There's a lot of ET species that tried to get into it, and
she's just fucking goodbye.

[00:37:02] You don't exist anymore. They're being Z into the fucking
defense of that. All right? So we could always step in. All right? But
yeah, I did this all on my own because I don't want to be codependent
with every anyone. I don't want to actually do a lot of the stuff.
It's like it just comes, all right, and you've gotta step up.

[00:37:20] I was still in my recovery from that hit. All right. It
took two months to put my brain back together, right in meditation. So
this girl basically found me, I don't know how the hell she's found
me, but it took three months, all right, from July to October where I
put her back together as well, right? And she's fine now.

[00:37:42] She's gone to ground and I, I call her Audrey. All right?
And the nickname for her is Audrey, as in Audrey Hepburn from the movie
of Roman Holiday, where she's like, this princess just having a
holiday. And Gregory Pack makes her. And she's like, like she's, the
metaphor is she's having a human Audrey Hepburn, Roman holiday
experience, all right?

[00:38:01] And all these high level stuff that was going on that I put
her back together to able to operate that level. All right? She was
going into galactic councils. The TER were coming in to helping us. So I
was using my high frequency field that the Ians could come in and do
psychic surgery on her. It was a freaking amazing.

[00:38:18] And the OC Arteri gave me a massive upgrade in my body. I
had all this black plot energy light. You imagine. You see inside your
body, you've got this black like tar, like spider web energy all
through me and stuff, and I've been to a lot of healings over a lot of
years and it's never been resolved. No one's ever helped me and all
that sort of stuff.

[00:38:34] So I've endured and pushed through. What they did is they
disintegrate all through me. So I got like 30% of my energy back after
30% I got back from Andrew, not vampire me. All right? Because if you
invest 10 months of your life, all right for free into something,
you're investing your life loss. And if you haven't worked out, money
is an encapsulation of human life loss.

[00:38:57] That's why it's a mechanism of trade, all right? As much
as you probably don't want money, it's a tool to trade that and value
people and stuff like that. All right? So I got a lot of energy back
from disconnecting from Andrew, instantly 30%, and I got to the level to
be able to work at this level to help this girl and basically prevent an
invasion of earth on top of all the other fucking shit I've had to do.

[00:39:19] All right? And that's why I'm sort of saying this
because. I've written posts and stuff and people have a hard time
visualizing, but it's like when I'm speaking, you can come into my
field and tune in. And that's the level of stuff I've done. I have not
been working with Nikki. All right? The justification of being disloyal
and all that.

[00:39:39] I haven't fucking worked with her. I've actually kept her
out of all this cuz it's, I gave until December 21 for it to be
resolved. All right. For Andrew to choose to do the right thing. All
right, so here we are. Moving on. So yeah, basically why I brought Lily
up is that he wrote, he told her that she's got this species and you
can't do anything spiritually and all that.

[00:40:03] Just before that, I'd fucking saved the earth and saved
this girl. Three months investing. And basically what I helped this girl
do because I hold space for it, is we ejected that fucking species from
the universe. Cuz after I helped her, right, there was two weekends
where I did four hour sessions on her and she was in a lot of trouble.

[00:40:21] And the first. On the Saturday and the Sunday, the
Saturday, what happened? The species tried to attack her and take us
out. What happens when stuff like that happens in these multi beings
like doing negative stuff? They'll put shit into your head to try and
disarm you and like cloud your perception and you know, get you
distracted and all sorts of, it's just childish.

[00:40:43] All right. And what happened on the Saturday? This bean was
trying to fuck with us and fuck with her and it was like it got
recycled. And the moment it's going down the gurgler like galactic
recycling, cuz that's something I'd do. All right. That's why I'm
released the Galactic Special Forces recordings cuz I've fucking gotten
rid of negative species Galactic Special forces.

[00:41:03] Part four was a species that was fucking with Nicki and I
and we went to Ed's rock in 2015 and cleared it. All right? All the
shit going on now, it doesn't matter. All right, we did it back then.
All right. And that's when we did serum. Sorry about that. I, um,
filled out my camera, which is interesting. Um, so I'm trying to get,
get back in the cloud just into my camera and cleared it out.

[00:41:27] So what I was saying was, the womb shakra that I operate
with came about through Nicki Betsy's Clearing, right? So all the
creative, all the fucking benefit, all the money that's been created is
based on what she did. She'd be grateful for that. All right? That
saved your whole business. All right? All the money and all that.

[00:41:49] All right. The worst time sticking with it. Like I said,
family are the ones are there when times are bad. All right? And then I
got hit, I almost got killed. All right. I'm not fucking joking about
that. I, it was like, it's the second time that that's ever happened
to me. All right, but I'll, I'll just finish off on the William
Sharker stuff.

[00:42:10] Is that December 21st, 2015, Nikki, uh, Mia, uh, Allegra
and another lady came to Adelaide. We cleared the city of Adelaide.
Nikki went in and like, Undercover into the massive masonic hole here
and fucking cleared out all the demons and all that. They were hating
her in it. She snuck in and she went and cleared the bathroom, the Sonic
Center.

[00:42:30] We cleared all the center of all the city with all water
and stuff like that in all the grid work. Then December 22nd, we went to
do work down south of the city, which basically revealed the wound
chakra related to the River Murray mouth, all right to the sea. And we
cleared it. And what she did, she opened her pu cause she does ancestral
clearing work of the wor of the earth.

[00:42:52] Opened her portal, created an opportunity for the dis
incarnated indigenous that had been genocide and and cured on the land
of the whole region. 1.1 million chose to access that and she gave them
a choice. You can either go and seed the five, the earth right from the
ancestral level because to have generations exist in a place you need to
have ancestral links and hand ancestral ties.

[00:43:16] She gave them a choice to do that or. Come back as light
warriors. 1.1 man chose to reincarnate and I've been in my city and
stuff like that, a lot of children, and they tune into me. They know I
can tell a lot on the soul level that they are some of the ones and they
look into my eyes and they're, can you imagine like a three year old,
like playing on a fucking train, just staring into the eyes?

[00:43:39] Like with pure gratitude from that like three year old
level, like it's a blessing. Alright? And I know that they're here and
they're seating the reality with powerful beings. Clear to their
camera. Thanks to Nicki, thanks to the clearing of the wound shot,
right? They've always holding and guarding, right?

[00:43:56] But since I've guarded and I put crystals in that I send
all over the world, it's very expensive. That's part of the money that
galactic history was gonna create, all right? To fucking do that grid
work. Andrew told me years ago, I'm sending, I'm seeding a knowledge
grid around the world. There's freaking countless people I've got to
get that to.

[00:44:14] And I've been living in poverty, fucking fighting all this
shit. For 10 years. All right? And I created that galactic issue
solution thanks to Earth giving the wisdom to me, outta my dedication
for supporting Andrew for all that crap, to finally get past the money
issue, to spot all that stuff. And Andrew just basically took it all for
himself, indeed revealed a massive fucking cart.

[00:44:37] Alright? He had to fucking do that to sabotage it all
right? To prevent all the positive potential that come with it. And now
he's playing the victim and all that sort of shit. But I've never said
my side of the story. I've stayed hidden. All right? And this is what
happened. Michelle came into my life.

[00:44:57] Then we did galactic history, uh, galactic Special Forces
work to clear and do the major work that we saw, all the 700 UFOs and
stuff. And then got a lot of birds. We have a lot of birds that pick
through the, that leaves here for insects and stuff. And they're just
like, Going nuts around here. So this is the order.

[00:45:20] Andrew's in trouble, right? For 10 months, Michelle came
in about the time I was needing to ration my food and ask for donations
and stuff. And I was doing a lot of healing of her because she had a
fallout with her ex-husband now who was a gambler, very toxic, and just
basically using her and abusing her, all right?

[00:45:42] For a financial benefit to feed his gambling addiction. All
right? So gambling is very toxic. She does meet him work, so she
entertains spirits and um, deals with a very high level of that, which
can be very toxic if you're dealing with that. All right? And she, in a
generous spirit, because what happens to your trauma if you don't
realize?

[00:46:03] You think people get boundaries and stuff like that. But
what happens is people lose the, the concept of what a boundary is when
they're totally, totally traumatized. So what she did, she had this guy
that was very, In a bad state. She let him move into her home, all
right, for free. And so he was basically occupying her space and messing
her up on another level cuz he was very toxic as well.

[00:46:25] And I helped her to get the strength to kick him out. All
right. And did a, her and her friend did a really amazing thing to
support him, get his car fixed and get him out. But she is a very high
level being, she works with mediumship and stuff. She cannot have toxic
people in her house. This guy was trying to get her to do naked
photography and all this sort of shit.

[00:46:47] And I was dealing with supporting Andrew. Plus I had her
come into my life and very, very toxic, right? I was just, every time
I've dealt with her, I need seven days to put myself back together
because it was so toxic. Plus, I was not rushing my food and all that. I
was on the edge. All right. So my birthday in February, she was very
generous and it resolved a lot of stuff.

[00:47:08] It took a lot of pressure off. I told Andrew what she did,
and you don't need to worry about me, blah, blah blah. Doesn't mean
you don't honor the work. Alright, I'm just saying take the pressure
off and we can get this done. So we're doing a lot of recordings and
building up to what was gonna unfold with Covid and no one picked that.

[00:47:27] All right? So my wisdom was to create something with a lot
of recordings, which is obvious. It seems obvious, but it wasn't. No
one fucking knew that I created an Empire New business model of
accessing, download podcast recordings and stuff of high level
conversations. I put it all together and I knew Andrew was gonna take
all the money, so I got hit all right, because I was vulnerable.

[00:47:56] I le, I'm not blaming him from my emotional state. I
don't give that power away, but I was. It was like brave heart on the
battlefield, doing all the fucking work and seeing the, the elders walk
away because they've sold out to fucking long shanks, right? And he
basically gives up, all right. I didn't give up, but I just, there was
something bigger going on here.

[00:48:18] And what I know it was, was a rider passage for Andrew to
not do the fucked up shit he's done to people in the past. Cuz he has,
and there's nothing, don't need to create illusions to stuff he's
been, if you, let's, let's use an example of car insurance, all right?
And I, it might have, it might change now on all that.

[00:48:36] But what I knew is if you're involved in an accident and
you are not your fault, the insurance never gives you a hundred percent,
all right? Because there's, there's a risk of actually being on the
road, all right? You choose to be on the road, that's a risk no matter
what. So you never get a hundred percent part.

[00:48:53] So if we use that metaphor, if you're entangled with
someone, you're not. Purely a hundred percent fucking innocent. You're
involved. You're a contributor. All right? Anyone playing themselves
out as a fucking like naive, poor me victim of everyone else's
bullshit. They're fucking hiding stuff. All right?

[00:49:14] What you do is you go and research both sides. You get both
sides of the story, and you put the picture together. I haven't told my
story of the side of this because unfortunately, I felt like I was
fucking raped. My womb Shakur was raped for its creativity that Nicki
fucking helped, all right? Okay. To create this enormous abundance
creation that I call a jock, John Wick level creation, all right?

[00:49:39] To solve everyone's fucking problems, and then I get
fucking screwed over and I almost get killed, and it takes me two months
to recover in that two months, all right? After the mission, I dis, I
sort of. I realized that this solution was there and I dedicated myself
to it. It took me two days to recover from the March 31st mission with
Michelle and this other lady.

[00:49:59] All right. Two days of physical recovery, and I do a lot of
physical work. I walk five Ks each way to my gym. I do an hour of sauna
and all that. I do weights and stuff. I walk with a backpack everywhere.
I walk to my market. Like I said, with backpack, I'm very fit. I'm fit
because it helps you recover from the hits.

[00:50:17] Like I said, I don't try and defend myself. I react to the
hits and I put myself back together as a P. I use it as a tool to
develop and get stronger. And what you do is because you're not
emanating the fear of the uncertainty of being over a cover, alright?
Because you're un fearful of your inability to handle this shit.

[00:50:37] I'm not emanating that energy, alright? Just think of that
subtlety for psychic defense. You learn the ME mechanisms to heal
yourself, or you have the allies and the people that you can turn to,
like I said, with Lily Hayes, Lil Hayes. Was the one I turned to about
this hit all right. Took me a month or two and I contacted her and I
just said, look, I fucking, and I confided in her that Andrew took all
the money.

[00:51:01] All right. Do you know how fucking bummed that is? A dumb
move. But that's the perception of people. They just like, he couldn't
fucking do that. He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that to our way.
So their whole questioning of loyalty and shit, it's because I've been
violated so massively. Right? And the only answer is to disconnect.

[00:51:20] I gave him two months and what happened? Right? This is the
interesting thing, and this is where I acknowledged Michelle Hibbs
integrity and all that. Because what happened was, as I said, she was a
client. She had a relationship with the neglect and history team. The
fucking negative shit told to her about me, about all this.

[00:51:43] It's just staggering. It's absolutely diabolical. All
right. So that tried to destroy her and plant a seed, a division in her,
because it was obfuscating the fact that Andrew took all the money and
got fucking caught. All right? Because what the galactic history two
thing was, was a choice. He, I allowed him to do what he wanted to do
with the money.

[00:52:07] And like I said, the, the waiting for me back in 2008 was
to not choose the money, because there's greater potential on the other
side of it if you don't choose the money. So everyone out there that
just has the potential to fuck someone at you, all right? Our ancient
future selves see it? Earth records, it goes into there, all right?

[00:52:28] In the future, when, like millions of years from now,
we're all tuning back into ourselves what we do now and we've always
done. So just because you, you can get away with it now, doesn't mean
you're all always get away with it. All right? So that's why I'm
doing this. In an honor to everyone out there to give you the data to
tune into.

[00:52:46] You can, you can project whatever you want to me, you're
right. I don't care. I've done the Gcic special forces level where I
almost saved earth through a fucking invasion. All right? If you can't
believe that, the reason why I left, I released the Gcic Special Forces
recordings, is for you to tune in and perceive that there's been bigger
stuff going on.

[00:53:06] And maybe I was in a role with Andrew to fucking make sure
that he didn't get fucking destroyed, all right? But in the end, he
destroyed me. All right? Cuz I see that as a compromise and all the
potential that money was meant to go to and do is all being prevented.
And that's the karma that's been accrued for that.

[00:53:25] And people that it's like the gold and the conquistadors,
which I saw the gold fever energy and stuff, um, the money encapsulates
the consequence. All right, so, Um, you tune into what you think and all
that sort of stuff. But yeah, this is quite long and it's quite
involved and there's a lot of information here, and you're welcome to
tune in and get healing or whatever you want from it.

[00:53:52] I do this in dedication to Michelle Haber and all the
bullshit she went through because of associated with me. I apologize for
having to disconnect, but like I said with Mandy Lynn, all right, and
Special Forces, sometimes they put you into deserts or forests and
you've got a fend for yourself. As a part of the Galactic Special
Forces level of require.

[00:54:13] You need to be able to be self-sufficient no matter what.
You need to hold your integrity true, and know that the answer, you
can't default to anyone because like I said, you give people epitome of
perception and defaulting to them. That leaves you massively vulnerable
to influence, and then you can be manipulated.

[00:54:31] All right? So you need to trust your gut and. Not even rely
on me because your integrity's better than me on many levels. Alright?
I'm offering that because I'm focused on all the multi-dimension and
the future potentials and all that and I'm trying to negate them all
the time. Alright? So thank you Michelle.

[00:54:54] Have an amazing birthday. Thank you for being in my life
and all of the lives that you benefit here in Adelaide, and the people I
know that are seeing the truth of who you are. Now, I'm very glad to
probably embarrass you by saying this, but let the world know how
amazing you are. You were the one that allowed galactic history to, and
the solution for fucking Andrew and all that potential that isn't
realized now to be birthed and you bought that, right?

[00:55:22] To be in that mystical experience and stuff, just recognize
that, you know, you weren't physically up to it and stuff and I'd told
you a lot of stuff before and you don't hearing and you're hearing
what you wanted to hear and stuff like that. But keep going. The person
that you are that I met last night compared to the year ago, it's
fucking amazing.

[00:55:40] And humanity and earth are gonna be much better off for you
to continue being and develop at that level. And thank you for
listening. Anyone that has gotten through this, I hope you've gotten
something from it. And you tune into my integrity and you see what's
happened. It's data, it's been done. We've gotta move forward and
keep going on.

[00:56:01] I am who I am. I don't allow people that choose money over
me into my lives. I walk away and I'll walk away. Not bitter, anything
like that. Just disappointed because I fucking have to reinvent
everything after I created a solution for everything, right? So, so,
good luck guys. Keep hanging there. Who knows.

[00:56:21] This video is just like, fuck it, you know, I've never
done a video like that. This is an opportunity to share and stuff like
that. So you can tune into me and listen to my voice and see me for
once, because I don't put myself out there and stuff like that. But
hanging there, guys, my perception of what's going on in November, all
right, this is a quick thing.

[00:56:40] November, I was telling my mate it's time to load up on
stocks. The reality is seeding to be put back together. And what's
gonna happen is the covid virus and all that sort of stuff. We're gonna
be looking back in 10 years time of the missed opportunities we had and
stuff like that. So, like I said, with the money and the potential and
the good work and the ions, that's definitely contributed to what is
gonna happen now.

[00:57:02] All right, so good luck guys. Hang in there. If you're,
after healing and stuff, infinite potential healing's gone crazy and
everyone's been, you know, benefiting well and stuff like that. So if
you want to explore that and your potential and what you can do, like I
said, with that girl, I saved a life and we basically ejected a species
from the universe that were very negative.

[00:57:25] You've got debt in your body that is an asset, right? The
negative karma that's been done to you. And we can play with that. So,
good luck guys. See you around. I'm just gonna add a quick app, quick
appendix to what I've sort of released and said there got only a couple
minutes to do it. Um, basically what part of the vision of galactic
history too was, was what to do with the money as well.

[00:57:50] So I'll say that because I used that for the discernment
process. All right? I allowed Andrew to do whatever he did, right? And
what he would do would gimme the discernment to work out what was going
on. All right? So Earth wanted him to have the first 25%, cuz like I
said, last 10 months were very bad. All right?

[00:58:11] What happened? What happened? I was there to help him. I
was loyal, sticking through him. I was doing all the admin, all the
emails related to the clients and stuff. To organize the bookings. And
that even though he pays for people to do that, I didn't take the money
for it. I left that what he was owing me relative to the video work that
hadn't been paid and stuff like that.

[00:58:31] Um, then the second 25% was for me, all right, to do all
the missions and all that sort of stuff. Earth wanted it done. I'm
loyal to Earth. I'm loyal to the William Shark. Whatever it does, I'll
do the best I can in any scenario. Like I said, I stuck with him through
all that bullshit and I created the solution to resolve it all
financially.

[00:58:50] All right? Then the last 50% was to go to the business, all
right? So he could afford to pay me the videos and all that were over
that were owed that haven't been cleared up and all that sort of stuff.
So that was the pattern, and if he did that, it would've been a beacon
to a massive audience out there that we can't even comprehend on
enormous abundance and stuff like that.

[00:59:14] On about the 30th of. April when I was still dealing with
the shit and had been hit, he couldn't perceive me and all that sort of
stuff. So one thing I've got is amazing camouflage now. So either he is
not tuning in or he can't read me at all and he wanted to get onto
creating lactic history 3.0. It was like, you're fucking kidding me.

[00:59:34] You haven't even paid me for that. You've taken all the
money, you've screwed me over, you've done nothing. I did all the work
like I do all the time. And then you want to get onto another thing cuz
you made a lot of money from what I'd done and you didn't even value
me. All right? So it was like, you're fucking kidding me.

[00:59:50] So what I did with the money and what I said Earth did and
what he did, I gave him an opportunity to prove himself. And what he did
was take it all for himself and gimme three grand and didn't give a
shit. You know, done what he is done and stuff. And clearing up Michelle
has been a massive effort cuz she couldn't believe because she
couldn't believe someone would do that fucking thing.

[01:00:11] Who has that status? All right. And it's just, I said to
her, look, you know, you can't assume, give people a pedestal of
perception because you default to them. You're vulnerable and you get
influenced. And that's what I said. Um, so take this as your will
discern me, cast me out. I've been destroyed. I saved the fucking earth
from an invasion after, and I've done all the other galactic special
force admission.

[01:00:38] I put all those people back together and stuff like that.
So you ch you choose by your actions. What I've done is I've separated
because there's an audience that isn't looking for that frequency. So
good luck guys. Cheers that the truth is revealed in action, not what
people say in action.

[01:01:09] I don't get into the like the drama sort of bullshit about
people, but what people do when they're involved in full, that they
usually create a false narrative around the people that they've fucked
over and stuff like that. But my focus has always been in loyalty to
earth and doing the grid work and the galactic special forces level
missions.

[01:01:30] The whole reason I came into Andrew was, um, during some
shows in early like May, June that I did with him, Natalie and Steve
Travesty in one of the breaks, he told me that some of the work that
we've done, there was a backup through Europe that required
disconnecting from the Vatican Energy harvest. So if you've listened to
the packet, special Forces recordings, um, Part two was related to
removing over 700,000 sacrificed children's OS from under the Vatican.

[01:02:05] All right? What that was, was the blood related to the, you
know, that negative soul capture was related to the blood that was put
on the post office. So you see mailboxes, they read and stuff like that
around the world. Every time an indigenous local reality was taken over
and indigenous rather genocide to move on to reservations or what, or
worse, um, a poster put on there and the blood was related to, um, the
cursed blood from these two insults.

[01:02:37] All right? That's how the false creators been laid over
the world. So we were doing the foundational removal of the work. So
I'm very, very aware of a high level of stuff, and the only reason I do
this work is my loyalty to Earth. In 2013, I did ancestral KA clearance
with Nikki Tesi, which totally cleared me of all the negative karma and
all that sort of stuff, right?

[01:02:57] So I did a lot of foundational work to do that. And in
order to do that level work and be ready for it in 24 7, you have to
have a huge level in integrity. All right? That's why Earth gave me the
vision to create Galactic history too, to create the money that we would
be all okay. And the money in part that I will get will go to do these
missions.
