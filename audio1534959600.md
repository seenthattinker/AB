[00:00:00] Wanted to be an interview. Okay, go ahead. So, uh, it's, uh, it's, um, pleasure to be here for this purpose. Okay. And go ahead, please. Okay, so this is Amir, and, um, it is, uh, Sunday, April 23rd. And this is an inter, an interview for, um, the, uh, the piece on Andrew Baris. So, Amir, when did you meet Andrew? Um, this was back in, let's say 2018.

[00:00:35] 2019. Oh, that far back, eh? Oh, yes, yes, yes. And, uh, so this was in, uh, I first came across some material online. I was searching for an answer. I found that the only person speaking about this was Andrew. Do you remember what the question was? Yes, absolutely. I was having, um, interactions with, um, non-human race of beings, uh, energetic beings.

[00:01:07] So again, not, not physical Yep. Uh, but very present in day-to-day life on our beautiful planet. And so a lot of these, uh, races are non-physical. Yeah. Multi-dimension. And so the, specifically the races, the tra Lloyds, the praying mantis beans, right? And so I'm looking for some information on this. And so I found that, uh, Andrew was, uh, perhaps one of the very few that had any material on this at all.

[00:01:41] So I was drawn to the material. I found some truth, uh, material. And so then I started, uh, watching the. The, um, sort of joining the live events. And in one of them, um, Roberts, may, he, may he rest in peace, um, selected me. And so we started speaking. So the conversation was very powerful. Uh, we talked about, uh, artificial intelligence, spirituality, how to empower, uh, computer code and so on.

[00:02:18] And this went on for about 20 minutes. And, uh, before I left the conversation, uh, Andrew asked for my email. And so from then, uh, we continued to, uh, maintain, uh, communication. So this was really positive. Uh, I was very excited, uh, about this. Uh, and, and I believed sincerely, I found somebody, uh, very knowledgeable, very powerful spiritually.

[00:02:49] And the energy was really good. Yes. So that was the beginning of this. Amir, do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your life and your search? Absolutely. So, uh, I grew up Yeah, go ahead. Go on. No, no, go go ahead, go ahead. I was born in Iran. Wow. 82. I did not know that. Yes, I was, I was born in Iran in 1982, uh, during the, the longest conventional war of the 20th century, uh, between Iran and Iraq.

[00:03:25] Yeah, yeah. So energy of war was everywhere while I was growing up, and so this had a profound effect on me energetically. Um, Iran is a, um, religious country, and, uh, it's also ruled by, um, religious clergy. Yes. So, um, all throughout my childhood and teenage years, we were, um, exposed to a lot of, uh, religious and also spiritual beliefs.

[00:03:57] And Iran is an interesting place. It's got a very ancient history in mysticism. Yes. It's the place of Zu Australianism. Yes. Some belief that's source of Buddhism. So yes, it's got a deep culture. Very beautiful. Yes. Um, I grew up, uh, with belief and then when I entered university, really entered society. I, I, I discovered that, uh, unfortunately what is preached is not practiced.

[00:04:25] And so that was the beginning of, uh, the dark night of the soul for me. Yeah. And, uh, I thought to myself, oh my goodness. Well, if these guys are not true, then the opposite must be true. So I started diving into the left hand path. Yes. Thinking, well, the adversarial path must have some truth to it. Yes. I was in this atmosphere after a long time of darkness.

[00:04:52] Uh, it gave me a lot of knowledge. Yes. And knowledge of an instrument. It's a tool. Um, it can be used with good intentions are bad. So basically I was in this, uh, path of spirituality, the left hand path. Uh, it deals with, uh, denser energies, heavier energies. Yes. The beings of that. And, uh, yet my saving grace was I was in it for the knowledge.

[00:05:21] And, uh, I never caused harm. I was really just eager to learn and I experienced many significant extraordinary things and. Um, I started on a, on the Buddhist, um, path of meditation, uh, the Ji Kiri, which really transformed me, uh, bringing me to a neutral, uh, stance. And from then I, uh, entered, uh, shamanic practice and, uh, this is about the time, uh, that I came into contact with Andrew.

[00:05:58] So, other than spirituality, most of my time I've spent studying and teaching. Um, yes, I've got, I've got, uh, seven academic degrees and a number of professional qualifications. Uh, uh, I've got a doctorate in brain computer interfaces. Oh. And, uh, post, post-doctorate in artificial intelligence. Wow. Uh, so Oxford just teach, uh, no, um, university of Essex.

[00:06:25] Okay. Okay. That's incredible. Now, who, who instilled this, who instilled this in you? Did you get this from your family? The pursuit of knowledge, the cultivation of mind? Um, well, we're all a family of academics, so the, the, the academia, of course was from them. But the, the spiritual part, I had this yearning since early childhood.

[00:06:49] Okay. Uh, I, I, I think that we're, we're born with this. I agree. Uh, we don't, we don't just do this kind of thing out of nowhere. Uh, um, when you're in this path, uh, you remain so lifetime after lifetime. Yes. And now after, after many years, I've seen many of my past incarnations, and so I know I've been a shaman on every continent on earth.

[00:07:15] Wow. I've practiced every single tribe of man, uh, wow. And the rights of, for different rituals and, uh, uh, cleansing activities. I think my earlier years when I went into the left hand path was again, um, passing the rights of passage to, uh, deal with these kinds of energies and entities in a just and compassionate fashion, uh, facilitating ascension and healing.

[00:07:43] Yes. Really none of, and none a non-violent way in a non, um, in a nonhierarchical way coming from a path of compassion. Yeah. Um, and so yes, this, this was with me always. It wasn't given to me by any particular person. Okay. Let's circle back. So I did a lot of research when I wrote the galactic historian. I went and I watched all of Andrew's early material.

[00:08:11] Oh, it must have been I maybe 50 60. Hours of YouTube. Um, some of it I had transcribed and read. Um, I like to take information in in a number of ways. I like to read it. I like to listen to it. Um, if you look at the 2013 interview at Mount Shasta with Lance, the zany mystic, there is in that video in 2013, an unmistakable innocence and purity about Andrew.

[00:08:45] Very simply put, what happened from that time till now? Well, I, I agree with you. Um, I believe that, that, first and foremost, the gentleman is gifted. Yes. Whoever has interacted with the gentleman will know this for a matter of certainty, the gift is real. Yes. And the innocence at some point was real. The intentions really were pure.

[00:09:17] And, um, that's a very heavy burden. Yes. Um, I'd really like to, um, deal with this subject with utmost, uh, respect and compassion. Um, agreed. Things don't out, things don't always start out to be, um, unsavory, but sometimes we just, uh, take a few too many wrong steps and they have an impact on us. Yes. Do you know any of those steps as they occurred in the life of Andrew Baris?

[00:09:55] Um, well my, um, coming into contact with him was much later 2018 19. Was he, was he, was he corrupted by this time in your estimation? I did not pick up. Anything intuitively. Um, I think that, um, he has a great sense of humor and, uh, that when he's at his best form, he really does care. Yes. Now I'm thinking that what really does get to people like this is trauma.

[00:10:35] Now, what this trauma might have been, it could be the death of somebody he deeply cared for or something of that nature, but that is an opening to the darkness. Yes. And so that's my, my own intuition about what was the starting point of this When, um, when, when the, um, The, the blonde woman who, uh, uh, I think Andrew described her as something of a poly, not a polyglot.

[00:11:03] That's somebody who can learn languages very quickly, but a genius. And, um, they f they fell in love. I know that she was married at the time. I don't hold that against Andrew. A loveless marriage is something that somebody can, um, seek solace outside of. And, um, but it, it brings up an interesting question, Amir.

[00:11:25] Why is there so much death around the galactic historian?

[00:11:34] Well, I think that things turned really sideways as time went on. This probably accelerated. And so the human body is a reflection of an energetic scaffolding. Uh, when that energetic structure is compromised, the physical body has no choice but to disintegrate or malfunction. Yes. And I think some of these energies, uh, interacting with people are just too intense.

[00:12:09] Many, many of us do not have the correct training, uh, or awareness, uh, to safeguard ourself energetically. Yeah. So certain types of, uh, let's say binding or energy harvesting, they can absolutely be lethal. I mean, look at our own culture, um, stories of, uh, vampirism that a vampire can feed on you and kill you.

[00:12:36] Well, there's no creature with fangs that drinks the blood, but people who can harvest energy from others without consent, this is an absolutely real thing. Yeah, so I think sometimes there may be too much take. People can't deal with it, the body can't deal with it. It results in a whole variety of illnesses.

[00:13:00] It's surprising that some of these illnesses are identical, so whatever energetic methodology is implemented is the same thing. Okay. So let me, let me restate what I think you said so that we're in, in sync. You're suggesting that some of the malady, okay, so first there's a trauma. We can assume what the trauma is.

[00:13:25] I don't have to necessarily, uh, state it, but this, this man who set out to do good and who was born with a gift experienced an extreme trauma. And in the course of that trauma, he may have consciously or unconsciously opened up to, um, darkness. Um, he may have made himself somewhat ill. And then as a result of that illness, he began to, let's say, and e examining it from maybe his perspective, give him the dignity of, of putting it in a benign way.

[00:14:00] He began to borrow a little bit of energy from people around him. Do you think that's fair to say? Oh, and one other thing that you mentioned, so you're talking about karma transference, like the, the immature healer can, rather than dissipate the energy of the other person ends up taking some of it on. Is this what you're saying?

[00:14:21] In in general, yes. Uh, this kind of mechanism is available to all of us once we go beyond a certain level of spiritual awareness. And therefore it is, uh, very heavily prohibited. I mean, even in the teachings of the left hand path, it's uh, interesting. They're not that many laws. But one of the most, um, emphasized laws is, uh, avoid psychic vampires.

[00:14:50] So even left-hand path practitioners know of the dangers of individuals that do this kind of thing. Now, whether it's intentional or not is a different matter, uh, but absolutely, uh, tempering with other people's life force harvesting their energy again through acts of, uh, emotional excitement or dampening to weaken the defenses and then access the energy.

[00:15:17] This is, this is a known thing, uh, among healers and also, um, different varieties of spiritual practitioner. Okay. Okay. Now say what you said again, but more definitively.

[00:15:40] You see, everything is vibration. Everything is mental. It's in the mind, it's in the intention. Yeah. And so sometimes, um, people may find relief in transferring heavy energy to others and taking clean, pure life force from them in exchange or transference of energy. Now, if this is, uh, let's put a case of a healer, uh, the healer will identify, uh, what's being slow, slowed down or blocked in the energy system or the body and transmute it, and in its place call in healthy flow of divine light, which all of us have access to.

[00:16:31] While I say all of us, the condition is that the heart is kept alive. Yes. Uh, what kills the heart is intentional and repeated acts of this honor. Yes. So, um, if the healer is of integrity, the person has a, has a living heart center, this is how spiritual healing works. Um, it's just a facilitation of a healthy flow of life force, which is all around us.

[00:16:59] It's the living, breathing cosmos. Yeah. So that's a positive way. Negative would be the opposite. Somebody is functioning well, living healthy, then somebody through whatever act or circumstance has accumulated then and an heavy energy, they can transfer this to the healthy person, take their vitality, and, uh, implant that negativity within the, within the other person.

[00:17:26] Mm-hmm. It's all about energy. So, With healing, of course, someone with integrity will always ask for permission to do any kind of work whatsoever. Uh, while when there's the negative transference, this is done without consent or the awareness of the person, uh, can be done without them being in physical contact.

[00:17:48] Uh, so this is really the nature of our reality. Uh, so I hope I've, uh, I've explained sufficiently. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. So do you have an approximate time? Um, by year, um, when this darkness came into, um, the, the self-titled person gh,

[00:18:18] honestly, this is, uh, perhaps before when I came into contact, so before 2018, even before, even five, six years ago. Yes, yes, yes. Um, I believe so. So this leaves, this leaves a very small window of time. So we have the interviews in 2013 with which we both agree are the public debut of the self-titled person.

[00:18:43] And then we catch up in 2018 and something has happened. Now that's five years, 2013 to 2018. Do you have any insight into those years that might help me even if they were not directly experienced by you, even if they were told to you by somebody else? Just for context probably will not make an like when you actually read the finished piece.

[00:19:08] You'll be amazed how little of what we talked about over our interview or interviews actually becomes a part of the story. So I don't want you to feel any hesitance. These recordings will be dis destroyed as soon as I am done the work. So there will be no record of this. Yes, sir. Um, my, my intention is not causing harm, uh, for, um, this gentleman or anybody, um, but because many, many people are involved in interactions with this person, and, and really what, what does not sit right with me is that it's resulting in a lot of harm.

[00:19:47] Um, I can't just, uh, ignore it, it doesn't feel correct, um, myself being one of these people. So, um, in answer to your question, I think that, uh, this gentleman was working with a lady, I think Natalie. So I, I don't, I don't remember, uh, seeing any videos of her, but this came into conversation with other people that when she passed, this was a significant point, um, of a point of infliction.

[00:20:21] Yes. Uh, where things went upside down. It was a very heavy loss. Um, I think after this, uh, lady passed, um, Andrew lost a piece of himself. Yeah. Uh, I think the pain was really heavy. And, uh, so I think that could be that point where things started to change. Um, again, going back to the beginning of the conversation, that trauma that is just way too heavy.

[00:20:51] Uh, it takes a lot of strength to heal the heart. And so if the heart is in pain and there's damage to the heart center, uh, everything goes to whack. Intuition, defense is, uh, judgment, emotions, the body itself. So I, I think that could be the moment that really changed stuff. Yeah. Yeah. How did this change manifest?

[00:21:21] Well, an unhealed heart, what would that do? Well, it dis, it, it it destroys the harmony of energy in the body. Yes. Um, an unhealed heart affects, uh, all other energy centers. So the can it way, can it produce cruelty? Uh, yes. That's, uh, that's unfortunately how, um, generational karma or generational curses are passed on.

[00:21:52] So somebody's abused by the parents is unhealed. They grow up, become parents, and then they in turn abuse their children. So yes, it can, it can be, um, sort of, uh, it can manifest as cruel. And, uh, or indifference to other people's suffering, or maybe even becomes perverted in, uh, extracting pleasure from observing the suffering of o others, uh, to find humor in this, uh, becoming sadistic or masochistic.

[00:22:24] Uh, but it also will have an effect on abundance, on creativity, uh, on, um, fortitude, moral fortitude, the ability to speak the truth, um, intuition and all other aspects of, uh, spiritual gifts. If the heart is damaged, everything is compromised. Okay. Okay, so let's examine some of the things that have happened in the time that you and I have known each other.

[00:23:00] This will be the most difficult part of today's interview, and yes, It's going to require that you, I suppose, speak more in, in, in the position of a witness and sort of for the moment, let, let's say, I don't wanna say forsake neutrality because neutrality is important, but just tell the simple and direct truth what happened with Robert Brown and John Edmonds as it pertains to the self-titled person.

[00:23:37] Well, I know more about Robert than, than I know about, uh, John, but I'm going to start with John Edmonds. Um, I believe the gentleman held a position of custodianship, um, in a very important location on Earth. Yes, there are many. Sacred sites, um, where portals exist and, um, usually with portals there comes conflict over ownership and so on.

[00:24:14] And so there was a very, very delicate truce, um, for a very long time, uh, which allowed everybody to sort of have access without conflict or bloodshed. And, um, it required a custodian to basically hold space for this whole thing to work a custodian in human form. So John was this, uh, being, it's, uh, a heavy burden and it takes a very special kind of, To accept this kind of, uh, responsibility of custodianship.

[00:24:52] And I believe one of the conditions of this truce, um, working was, um, was silence, uh, was not, uh, publicizing, uh, the exact nature of what was going on there. And so I believe after this, this condition was broken, it gave, um, it gave access to, uh, certain elements to basically caused harm to John. So I believe that this whole thing of exposure did not do him good.

[00:25:32] Well, I don't know if I ever shared this with you, but one of the last things John said to me before he became very ill, you know, so. I will begin. I will speak now from my perspective, very shortly after GH the World, according to the self-titled person published, a very strange thing happened. The self-titled person became much more interested in another book that I published rather than his own.

[00:26:11] And right away, this sent, this sent up red flags for me. Like, yes, why is he doing this? So very quickly, and you can map this all out through the Friday comedy shows, if they're not taken down. There's one show I actually say on air now. I say on air, I have to leave early. Today I have an appointment with some Harvard professors.

[00:26:36] So this event happened where people became the book, did what we hoped it would do. It sent a bell out and, and I guess at this point John was asking for help, not help, but he felt that he, he could do more with talking about what was going on there. And so in the writing of the book, we sent out this signal and it got answered, and it got answered by a gentleman with a PhD in medical physics and another gentleman who was a post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Medical School.

[00:27:13] And. They wanted to do an experiment at, um, Stardust Ranch, very innocuous experiments, small devices plant planted around the house, and they only upload like in, in a minute. It wouldn't even hit a megabyte. It's just kilobytes. So very non-intrusive. And they, they came to me first and they said, um, they were afraid to approach John directly.

[00:27:41] I said, okay, I, I will speak to him. And I spoke to John and this is the conversation we had, which you have brilliantly, um, given an exposition on it, simply from your intuition, which is quite remarkable by the way. John told me exactly what you just said. He said, Bruce, there's a truce here. There's a delicate balance.

[00:28:04] Okay, if I go too far in publicizing this, they will punish me. And I said, okay. But you wrote the book clearly. You do wanna get the message out. We started the book in 2012. I quit. You tried to do it with three other writers. They quit the Amir. Without patting myself on the back or sounding heroic here.

[00:28:31] What you have to be able to tolerate to write a book like Stardust Ranch is mind boggling. Okay. I I, yeah. The level of harassment is my, my wife almost had a nervous breakdown. We had a, we had a ball of white light appear in the house. She took a photo, they analyzed it at Harvard. Not, not, not fluorescent.

[00:28:53] Not in candescent light, not of the world. Not light knot of a manmade. Okay. That was they, you know, and that's just one of the things that happened. I had portals opening up with very ranked smells. I had furniture move around. Nobody was attacked. I was in a constant state of prayer. So when I do a book like that, I become almost, um, Eastern Orthodox.

[00:29:19] I, okay, so the Eastern Orthodox path to God realization is perpetual prayer. You start praying when you wake and you pray all day quietly. You don't even tell Pete, this is how I work on these books. This is my secret. This is what gets me through. And, um, so I knew John was not exaggerating. I knew he was, uh, telling the truth.

[00:29:43] Now I counseled him to go forward. And then a TV show came in as well. Okay, now this is where the, the self-titled person, I will give you my take on his character. I cannot speak to the trauma in his life and trauma opening him up to darkness. I see the self-titled person's weakness as the same weakness as all other human beings.

[00:30:11] He cannot control his desires, so he saw Stardust Ranch as a launching pad for him to get a be a bigger audience. He, like I said, it became very bizarre. All of a sudden, we weren't even talking about the book we just wrote anymore. We were talking about the first book I published in D, December 31st, 2019, and I found that very strange.

[00:30:39] Then he literally, when the TV series became a reality and the producers went out to. Uh, Arizona to meet John slightly. Before that, the first thing the self-titled person asked me, wa, was to meet all the players. I denied him a meeting with the Harvard people. I, I, I, I felt that, that those discussions were just a little bit too rational for the self-titled person to fit in.

[00:31:09] I gave, I, I introduced him to the producer who was, uh, working on a series, had worked on Stardust Ranch and was working on a series called Blind Frog Ranch. Basically had done two of these mysterious ranches already and was interested in Stardust, and saw it as the one with the most potential out of all three.

[00:31:30] This person also had started to talk to me about writing a book about the World War II experience of some native tribes in Alaska who were colonized by the Japanese and World War ii. After meeting with the self-titled person, she broke off all contact with me, would not take my calls. When I followed up on the book and they'd already given mat me material, they'd already given me a thesis that was written by a PhD student, and they were setting up interviews with the chief of the tribe and some of the elders.

[00:31:59] Then all of a sudden, everything stopped and the message I got from her was, well, we wanna get this done right. Bruce, quote unquote, she stopped talking to me. She stopped talking to me about Stardust Ranch, so you can clearly see what happened. The self-titled Per the self-titled person, stabbed me in the back and stole an opportunity that was in my timeline based on 25 years of self-discipline in the practice of creative writing.

[00:32:27] Yes. And his energies went in there and tipped the flow of things and got John Edmonds killed. Yes. And, and so we, we spoke about this delicate truths yes. Being, maintain, maintained perhaps for centuries or millennia. Yes. And, and that there are absolutely many players, uh, that would like monopoly or a bigger slice of the pie.

[00:32:58] And so getting rid of the custodian, manipulating of energies on earth in our reality would be part of this game. So again, this would point out to this gentleman being manipulated by some of these energies that have a stake in keeping the world as we know it, uh, in the energy and modus operandi as we know it, right?

[00:33:25] So this is not at all surprising. Betrayal, uh, character assassination. So recently I faced the music too, and so it does not surprise me. Uh, this is very much a spiritual war, and I believe that this does involve the destiny of our species, maybe one part of many parts. But if there are portals on earth that give access to all sentient, kind in the cosmos, that would include beings that would not be happy with the system that is in place.

[00:34:03] So if their access could be limited, then that would be a big objective for these energies, these forces. Now, is this self-proclaimed gentleman knowingly doing this, or unknowingly? Well, honestly, after a certain point, that really doesn't matter anymore. Yes, agreed.

[00:34:29] So, and your second question was, go ahead. Sorry. Your second question was about Robert. Well, um, I really didn't have much interaction with Robert until, well, I started working with David and this happened after Covid. Um, we'd had a long conversation and, uh, by the way, introducing David, uh, the gentleman is rather spectacular.

[00:35:08] Yep. Uh, very, very well studied, very capable, uh, intellectually and spiritually, um, an outstanding individual. So we hit it off. We decided to, um, Start doing broadcasts on, uh, spiritual, uh, related topics. And this went on for about, um, I think 10, 10, 11 months or something like that. Well, we did probably around a hundred, uh, live shows, something in that order.

[00:35:48] So, um, within the two, um, quote unquote separate companies, one being U C M and one being gh, there was this rivalry, I don't know if the nature of it was a losery or just trying to keep, uh, people working with these, uh, with this, these organizations under control. But, uh, there was always this sense that, um, okay, David believed he could do everything better than everyone.

[00:36:17] And Robert was under pressure, um, by, um, By Andrew, uh, to up his game. And so this was always a source of great amusement for David, uh, watching the struggle of this poor man. And so this is now this whole thing of me actually speaking to Robert until his death is probably a four month period, three, four months.

[00:36:49] It's not a long time. And so somehow, uh, David has, uh, control over the finances of everybody, including Andrew. And, uh, so we can speak about why I believe that is true as we continue the discussion. But sticking with, uh, what, uh, went with, uh, Robert, uh, he was under a lot of pressure. So David had access to payments.

[00:37:19] Um, and, uh, Robert has, uh, Has a family and a young daughter. Right. So he was under a lot of pressure. Yeah. David was manipulating when he got paid, delaying his payments and so on. And, uh, this was why basic, just causing stress for him. Why? I think there was some sort of enjoyment in enjoyment in watching her suffer.

[00:37:47] Um, I mentioned this many times that I really feel bad for Robert's daughter. I I mentioned this many times that yeah, you gotta think about the, this young lady and basically, uh, you're not just messing with an individual, you're messing with the family and so on. What was the, what was the basis of the enmity?

[00:38:09] Was it, was it just a cat playing with a mouse or was there something about Robert that irritated? Um,

[00:38:20] I think David is a very vengeful person that holds onto a grudge and never Lets go. Something going back and forth with, uh, I think Robert joining U C M and then going back to Andrew, something of this nature. So there was a, there was a hostility in all of this. And so David basically made sure to make poor Robert's life, uh, as difficult as possible by, by manipulating when he got paid or not paid for that matter.

[00:38:56] Okay. Um, and later on, um, there was some sort of a upheaval in, in GH where Andrew wanted to do some, um, material with me. Um, by that time I had also been basically, Um, turned against Andrew, uh, very effectively by David. Yeah. So he, he made sure that I became aware of all the dirt he had on Andrew, and so this is why I believe Andrew has lost sovereignty, uh, completely to David.

[00:39:38] Um, yeah. And, um, now this is, this is David's profession, right? He's, he, I believe he, he's a black book guy. He, he get, he's, he's kind of like a, a Jeffrey Epstein light, a keeper of, um, blackmailable material. Right? Well, in the case of Andrew, that's more certainly true. Okay. And, uh, so yeah, he has some intimate footage, uh, of Andrew, I believe one of the people you are speaking to is that person, Eleanor and, yep.

[00:40:15] I think it's the same person. So I just saw a screenshot of this whole thing going on, but, uh, yes, uh, material of an intimate nature involving three people. And I would imagine Andrew is scared to death of this coming out. So that's the hold. Uh, David has on Andrew is, is Andrew, is Andrew bisexual?

[00:40:42] I couldn't say for certainty, but the video was of a threesome. Um, him and two him and, okay, go ahead. Yeah, one man and one woman other than Andrew. And so I don't even want to think about what David did to get hold of this footage, but he certainly kept it. And so Andrew jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.

[00:41:10] Mm-hmm. Now, and so that's the, yeah. Go on. E Eleanor was the, was the meeting point for Andrew and David. Right? Do you know Eleanor? Uh, not personally, no. Never had any interaction with her. Um, is she a friend on Facebook? Yes. You might wanna drop her, uh, uh, a DM and say, uh, I've been debriefed by Bruce. I am one of the people working on this piece, and if you need any healing or protective energy, let me know.

[00:41:44] We can speak briefly. Um, all conf, all confidence is kept. Um, she's just trembling when you speak to her. Just absolutely trembling like, it, it's, it's right outta a horror movie. Okay. As you, as you're, as you know, as you are speaking, I'm just tuning into her. And Yes. Uh, poor thing. She is traumatized. Yes.

[00:42:11] And I think I will be able to offer, um, offer something positive, uh, because she is in a very delicate state. I would kindly ask you to extend my offer, uh, to her. Um, I will not ask for any, um, any kind of money or anything like that. I just want to see the poor lady relieved of what she's been carrying for probably far too long.

[00:42:38] So, yes, please say that I, I'm, I'm, this is who I am, this is what I do, and I offer to help. If she accepts it, then I'll proceed. Cause I'm aware she's in a very delicate state. I don't want. I don't want to cause her, uh, any additional stress. Okay. I've just passed the message. Um, excellent. She's lining up other people, so I'm gonna have to exercise extreme delicacy in this.

[00:43:06] And, um, you know, I don't want anybody's dirty laundry exposed. Um, I actually had a moment of sympathy when you told me about, um, sympathy for the self-titled man when you told me what David has. Um, sir Bruce, I, I, I, even right now, as we're speaking, after everything has been said and done, the only thing I feel for Andrew is a deep sense of love and compassion.

[00:43:40] Yeah. That, that, that he, you see, we're human. Sometimes we mess up. But nobody deserves to be in this kind of predicament. Yeah. And it is the most terrible predicament Where Well, it's damaging, it'll destroy the man. Now why? Why would David share this with you? What's the end game there? What's the play?

[00:44:07] Okay. Because Andrew wanted to join with me, and he, I suppose, recognized some potential in me. We were actually at one point talking about creating a university together, even going into the details of what the building would look like and so on. I really loved the man. Right. And, and, and after this whole ordeal ended, like had time to examine what had happened, the love.

[00:44:38] Deep down whatever this man has done or has been involved with, I think there's still that, that spark of divinity inside, which refuses to let go no matter yes. What the involvement is. So the, the compassion is absolutely there, but David wanted that this alliance never forms. So David wanted, um, on his side and so he completely poisoned me against Andrew, including stories of how in Barbados he added M D M A to somebody's ayahuasca, nearly killed a poor kid, and how he did this and did that, and how he's harming people.

[00:45:22] And that really got to me that point that he was harming people. And a again, the reason I've come forward this whole interview, my going on online public. With my part of the story is that this is not okay. Harming people systematically harvesting their energy and resources, not only not giving them anything positive, but then causing so much damage, including death.

[00:45:53] Um, I can't, I can't just be silent. Yeah. And I, I dedicate this to the prime creator. Whatever comes, comes. Okay. I know these people are dangerous. I really do. And, uh, so listen, let me speak to that. Okay. I, I, you need, you need to stop worrying about that. Okay. The amount of protection we have to do this is mind boggling.

[00:46:21] I won't go into it. I mean, even, even, even Bob has reached out, he, he picked up, he felt the disturbance in the force and reached out. And I recently, I rec, pardon me. He reached out to me also. R r Bob? Yes. Bob Hill. No, no, no, no, no. This is the guy I wrote the light of darkness with. Oh. Oh, okay. Different Bob.

[00:46:47] Yeah. So, um, yeah, and so there's a lot of people aware of what's going on. Now, let me tell you, uh, what's going on with Andrew. Andrew accepts all of this. He's not going to fight it. The fight was last October 29th when he attacked my son and I, okay. He was, he was tr he, he, he saw the future, what was coming.

[00:47:11] He, he saw six months into the future. Um, he realizes now that it just, the, the magical attack on me and my son just is sort. Put me in a position of resolve so that if Spirit turned the roulette wheel of life and put this opportunity in front of me, I would not hesitate. So he really, he really dug his own grave.

[00:47:36] October 29th. Andrew accepts everything that's happening. He's almost like the Marlon Brando character in Apocalypse Now accepts his death, you know, and, and I'm Martin Sheen going up the river with this piece I'm writing about Andrew now. It's unfortunate. But at the end of the day, Andrew got himself into this and he's responsible for his actions.

[00:47:59] And I will mention, I will mention what a, what David did. Okay. And I will mention that Andrew got leveraged, but a person of Andrew's consciousness should never find them in a po. Find themselves in a position where they can be leveraged this way. So, you know, Sex, drugs and rock and roll. It just shows you none of us are immune.

[00:48:24] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's, you know, it, it, it's one of the few things about a physical incarnation that you can't really get anywhere else is just, is the pleasure of a physical incarnation. You can get good feelings on the astro, you can get con, you can get contentment and a kind of cosmic consciousness on the, on, on the causal and the mental planes.

[00:48:47] But pleasure is unique to the physical plane, you know, and, and, and so it's completely understandable. People, um, you know, participate in it. Um, you know, I I, I'm no stranger to the pleasures of the census myself. I, I had a grand old time when I lived in Taiwan for two years, from 92 to 94, you know, and, um, but, but this is in, in, in, in title of spiritual service in public.

[00:49:18] It becomes defamatory to all spiritual practitioners at the end of the day. The self-titled person has put themselves in a position where they're almost like, you know, Jimmy Swaggart getting caught in those $20 Fleabag motels in Texas with crack, whos like two, three times. You know, the first time is congregation forgave him and that it, you know, he, he, he has to be accountable and certainly attacking myself and my son with black magic.

[00:49:46] He doesn't realize how unbelievably stupid that was. It it, what he did incidentally, and this is why I realize he's so weak now, is he is making so many mistakes. Okay. By doing that, he just gave me all the proof I need to write this. So when people tell me he like you, sh when I speak to Eleanor, she says, well, Bruce, you're not going to believe she has a Barbadian accent too, by the way.

[00:50:09] She says, well, you're not going to believe this, Bruce, but I said, believe me, I will believe it. Okay. And she says, well, it's non-physical stuff. You have to be a spiritual, I, I believe it. Okay. Because he, he, he, the stupidest thing he did is what he did to me in my son October 29th, be because he basically set this whole thing up.

[00:50:29] And this is, I don't believe he's this stupid. I believe this is his way of taking himself out. He himself believes it's gone too far and he can't figure a way out. Yes. And I think that before he attacked, uh, you and your son, uh, he tried the same thing on me. And, uh, I was able to, Hold my own, but it was deeply unpleasant.

[00:51:01] Um, very, very irritating, agitating feeling. Uh, while I was under attack, uh, I was finding it difficult to regulate my cardiovascular system, uh, breathing heartbeat. And, uh, so I looked into what was being used. He was using, um, a number of crystals to amplify his, uh, focus. I reached out to the crystals and asked them, uh, is this what you signed on for?

[00:51:36] And I got a response, uh, in the, in the energy of, oh hell no. And so the crystals went to sleep. Wow. Uh, that's what they do. And they will never work for him anymore. So the tools that he were, he was using, Those instruments. And by the way, this is a segue, but crystals are beautiful companions. They're sentient.

[00:52:01] Yes. And they didn't, they did not like what was being done. And also, well, let's, now we're talking about attacks. Uh, by the way, I haven't forgotten the rest of, uh, Bruce's, uh, Robert's, uh, Robert Brown's story, but yes, he also attacked Laura Massey and, uh, sent her into hospital. Um, well, why, why is she still working with him?

[00:52:29] Well, she's ranked the Kool-Aid, right? And, um, even to this day, she thinks that he saved her life while really he was the one causing the psychic attack and the stroke-like symptoms. And I say stroke-like that was what I was feeling. And, uh, if I was of a weaker. Awareness. It would've probably worked on me too.

[00:52:55] But yes, she's invested. She doesn't want to believe she's gone wrong all this time. She goes way back with Andrew, so she's in there. So do you know that And, uh, that, you know, you know that another one of his mentorship students, David, is in the hospital now. I, Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave Farrow in North Carolina.

[00:53:17] Oh my God. I know the gentleman. Yeah, I did some, I did some healing work on him. And, uh, um, so this, please keep this part, uh, between you and I, word of honor. Um, yes sir. So his solar plexus was being messed with. And, uh, David Farrow is a very interesting soul. Um, he is the consciousness of, let's say, a central sun.

[00:53:49] Central galactic son. Very, very powerful being. And he is living a role of, um, maintaining the delicate balance of life on earth, uh, through shamanic practice and chaun, uh, a master in his own right. Uh, but again, it's just, it just shows you that nobody is immune if you are open to these energies without consciously safeguarding yourself.

[00:54:22] So this is, they will, this is the self-titled man Messing with his solar plexus. Well, now that this is all being said, this is a new revelation for me, but, um, I don't believe in coincidences where people who are in contact with this gentleman become severely ill. And different types of disturbance happens with their energy, uh, right leakages in his solar plexus.

[00:54:53] Now imagine a son inside the body with the same intensity of our son, and suddenly part of the boundary protecting the body is cracked. And then beams will come out and basically cook the flesh and said, the spiritual energy of this gentleman is of that order of magnitude. So why would somebody wanna do that?

[00:55:17] Well, if you're hungry for energy, anything,

[00:55:24] there's a confirmation. Yeah, that's my dog having a yawn on the floor. Um, I've had, I've had, I, I've lost count, but I've had four or five cats drop litters in the last week and a half. I think I'm up to about 19 cats now. It's a, it's a psychic fortress, Amir? Yes. Yeah. Or without a doubt, they're, they're, they're, they're, um, vessels for very powerful types of energy.

[00:55:55] Yeah. Without it, this is known, so, okay. So that's Dave Farrow. Um, Martina has sort of gone her own way. I think she probably has begun to, I think she was the most aware of, of, of, of that group. I, I could be wrong. Maybe after listening to you, it was Dave Farrell. I don't know. But, um, Martina, I've had interactions with her.

[00:56:19] She's a straight shooter. There's no, there's no darkness or distortion in her. She does her own thing and does it well, and more power to her. But she's separated. She's not involved in any of this. Right. What about, what about the youngster? You know what, what about um, that, that nasty little Matt Waller, that, that sort of ha has the visage of a thug for sure.

[00:56:46] Um, well, the guy is a thug. Yeah. It's not just a, he's got a criminal record. He's a marijuana dealer. Yeah. So, yeah. No, well, you know, there's, there's no shame in living life, adventurously. Well, but look, I mean, this yearning this year, by the way, I'm well into theist materials on the show. I've, I'm, I'm up to like Lieber Lieber nine now.

[00:57:15] Well, one of, yeah. One of, one of the things that the Marists caution against is, is the lust for consciousness and the lust for energy. And Matt has, Matt has that in spade. I did two interviews with Two Feathers, and if the second one, Maddie joins, and halfway through the interview, he openly admits to, um, having sex with his own children to produce light.

[00:57:41] Um, oh yeah. I was consi, I was considering using it in the story, but there's, oh, He, he, he says it right out. He, you, you, you have to listen to the context like the, the, the, the, the gentle bearded one. I forget Dale Tobin. He said something and I said, oh my God. He said, you know, I mean, you're making me think of something else here.

[00:58:03] This sort of like, you know, child, you know, child pedophilia and stuff like that. And then Matt piped in, he said, well, Bruce, you know, that can be very beneficial. We practice it in my family, and if you do it without any thoughts in your head, you can produce all kinds of light. And I just thought to myself, well, here it is right here.

[00:58:21] I mean, there's the, this is, yeah, God. Yeah. Okay. That's new to me. So even Dale Tobin, the gentle bearded one is into this. No, no, no. Mad, mad. Maddie was the one who said it. So Matt, Matt's got kids as well, right? So, yeah. Um, so Tobin, uh, he's, he's, he's his, his energy. Is very soft. Yeah. And, um, I kind of feel for the guy because he's got something else coming with these people they've already taken over his entire show.

[00:59:00] Yeah. Back in the day. And it was just him, it was clean and innocent. Yeah. Now, the latest broadcast, they used his, his work, his show to basically, um, run this character assassination campaign on me. Yeah. I mean, like, for example, saying that I sleep with clients. Well, well, there's a little problem there. I live in the uk.

[00:59:27] All these clients are in the us I can't reach them. Yeah. Uh, you see by again, this is done in his name also. That is not a good thing. Yeah. So, um, a, a gentleman by the name of Brian Longsdale reached out to me. Do you know him? Langdale lives in Washington state, in the mountains. Um, yeah, I, I, um, so again, this was one of the people, quote unquote people of interest.

[01:00:00] Oh my God, Bruce, there's so much to talk about. People of interest for this. Um, let's say u c m creatives. Please let me go on this tangent. I don't wanna forget this. Okay, so down Brian, so there was this event, U c m creatives. Now there's something about this U C M thing that they have difficulty, um, getting people to trust them.

[01:00:26] So for a long time, I became the face and so people interact with me. And of course, I really didn't know what was what with these guys until they really stabbed me. So I brought in, um, a wonderful couple from Australia. The Palm Makis. Yes. Uh, I brought in, um, really gentle, beautiful lady from Romania, Ruxandra Pan, and, um, um, another lady from California, um, Mauser, Jessica Mauser.

[01:01:07] And so we collected this little group of, uh, uh, people each with our own talent. And so there was this show, quote unquote U c m creatives, where Kylie Pasky, she's got a gift for writing like yourself. She creates, uh, revocations. So she created a revocation and we were all reading this out. And lo and behold, um, David pulls out a Penta Graviton Sigil right on camera on the live broadcast and does a binding ritual on every single person there.

[01:01:45] What does, what does that do? It basically gives them access to people's energy so you can continuously harvest, um, their energy, their abundance, their life force, and so on. Oh, by the way, because I was involved, I had the moral and ethical permission to destroy this binding, not just for myself, but for everybody there.

[01:02:11] And in my mind I saw that, that, uh, uh, pentagram, which was on a stone slab crack, and, uh, so releasing myself and everybody else from this energy harvesting mechanism. But that's something that is prevalent. And in fact, I think, I mean now, after all is said and done, that this u c M and GH is pure and simple in energy harvesting, racket targeting beings of light.

[01:02:41] Yeah, to, that's what Andre, that's exactly where Andre Hodge has arrived. Okay. Yeah. So, yes. Interesting. I'm, I'm, I'm having a session with Andre next week. Well, tell him, tell him I want to speak to him. He's, he's afraid of me. He, he's very guarded since g since the self-titled man, his experience. I've reached out to him a few times and he got back to me once and he said, you know, I'm very, I had to pay for a session before he would talk to me, because he had, yes.

[01:03:13] I said, well, I don't mind doing a session, but why do I have to pay for it if it's just to validate my intention to speak about, you know, I, I'll be honest with you, Amir. Um, I'm gonna be very honest. I, you know, I grew up very tough. Scottish Catholic family, heavybag speed bag in the basement. I could knock out an adult male by the time I was 15 with my left hand.

[01:03:35] I do not like cowardice. I don't like it. It, it doesn't serve anything. It's one of the, you have, there are times in life you have to be brave and, and exactly. And I find, and if you can give him a little nudge in my direction cuz he is an important person to round out the story on the self-titled man. Um, I will, I will do my very best.

[01:04:00] Dear Bruce. Uh, I think they put this poor man through the ringer. Oh yeah. Um, is a very gentle soul. Yeah. They really fucked him up. And please excuse my language. Yeah. But they really did a number on. And so going through that, he's still on the side of extreme caution. So I had to go through the same barriers.

[01:04:27] So he has designed a system to safeguard himself, uh, extreme protection. And so I was okay with it. I, I also paid up front. I genuinely wanted to see his approach and also see what he has discovered, because he's been in this, uh, situation for a little longer than me. Yeah. And then seeing, well, I'm, I'm, I'm also, um, somebody of, um, somebody that has the honor of being gifted.

[01:05:01] Yeah. And so once I see something done, then I know how to do it. I pick up pretty, pretty quickly. And, and again, just, just to, I wanna be transparent. Uh, growing up in Iran, there's an old tradition that all the, the Sufis. The masters, they all have a little profession. Yes. Uh, one is a shoemaker, one is a carpenter.

[01:05:25] One, I dunno, was bok does food and this and that. And they ask them, well, why do you have so many devotees? Why work? And the answer to that is because then you don't have to do something that your conscience says. No. Just because you have to eat. Yeah. So, as you know, I spent a year with the Sufis, the MEV Levy order in Toronto.

[01:05:49] And the Shake, the Shake, they, they don't accept any money. It's true spiritual service. And this particular shake, uh, he and his wife just ran a small jewelry making business from home. He worked 10, 12 hours a day. But a lot of times, It's very beneficial to meet these modern masters because they'll teach you how to integrate spiritual life into the modern world, find prayers to do while you're working and things like that so you can turn it into spiritual work and material work at the same time.

[01:06:18] Very important. I myself, uh, put earplugs in. I tune into the shabda, the sound current, and I meditate when I do my technical writing. So I'm, my life's almost monastic now, you know? You know. Yeah. With the formal meditation, sitting cross-legged, plus the working meditation, I'm averaging anywhere from, you know, three to eight hours of meditation a day.

[01:06:40] And it's, it just the, it's, it's remarkable, you know? So, anyways, we're getting back. We're getting back off track. So Andre Hodge, we want to bring him in and, um, yes. So do, do you think Robert Brown was, uh, died as a result of this energy harvesting? This is not something that I can prove, let's say in court.

[01:07:08] All I have is, uh, information that I have heard and my intuition. So firstly, we talked about Andrew and I having the potential to create some new material courses and, uh, talks about creating a university and so on. Uh, so I was basically poisoned against him by David. So then at the final stages, um, Robert, uh, Andrew and Robert, believe it or not, they created some stuff, some, some material.

[01:07:44] And I have absolutely no doubt that David's manipulation continued and, uh, to a point where Robert said, okay, unless I get paid, I'm not going to, uh, give you access to the material. He said this to Andrew. Where Andrew basically lost his cool and fired Robert. Okay. And so, and then, uh, so this is the reason that that, that Andrew fired his old friend again through manipulation from David.

[01:08:15] So David didn't like the guy he persisted on seeing through his downfall. And then about a week later, um, we were talking to David and, uh, Nicki, this, uh, shadowy figure, uh, I like to think of her as David's pet Scorpion. Yeah. We were talking together and he said, oh, well, Andrew fired, uh, Robert. And he, he denied me the satisfaction of doing so.

[01:08:48] But then yesterday I got all the passwords from, got every access to everything. By the way, uh, in brackets getting even more control over Andrew. So Andrew doesn't have control of his website, his email, the mailing list, nothing brackets closed. And that is when I think that David did something energetic to Robert.

[01:09:16] Now, very shortly after this, my association ended with these guys. Uh, so basically there was a massive hack on my systems. Everything was hacked, and, uh, messages were sent out from my Facebook, again, out of all people to Laura Massey saying, yes, this and this. I, uh, I, I want to give information to Andrew and this and that.

[01:09:41] Um, basically I got into a lot of difficulty because I had, uh, confidential material from my academic work on my computer. Uh, working for the government. Yeah. And so I had to, by contract, inform them of the breach. So they put me through the ringer two. And so this was, uh, resulted in, this, resulted in, um, basically parting ways with, uh, U C M.

[01:10:12] Now, at this point, I had, uh, I'm not gonna go into that. I wanna stick with, uh, with Robert. I, I, I feel energy trying to divert my attention from this. Mm-hmm. So it was at this, this, uh, event where David got the passwords where I believe he did a number, an energetic sabotage on Robert, because very shortly after, um, he got diagnosed with cancer and before the end of the year he passed.

[01:10:42] Yeah. And, uh, so do you, do you honest, do you honestly attribute this level of darkness to David? Is he a murderer? This is what we're talking about. Let's speak openly and honestly. We're talking about murder. I suspect he's done it with his hands, not just through, uh, energy harvesting. You just read my mind.

[01:11:06] Um, my friend, uh, it's see, taking, uh, or let's, let's put it this way, extinguishing a light requires a certain mentality. Uh, yeah. Which with David's background, I absolutely believe that he's capable of, so the level of darkness that was, um, sent my way would make me think that murder is this guy being merciful because he likes to play with food, play with, yeah.

[01:11:39] He's got some, he likes to play with his food like a cat. Causing Max. So with he, he, he's got a favorite saying when he was messing with Andrew through manipulation. And then with Robert, and I suppose now with myself, he likes to follow the practice of death by a thousand cuts. It gives him immense enjoyment.

[01:12:04] So I think he just suddenly ended or brought about the end of Robert. Yeah. So yes. Is he capable of it? Oh, absolutely. Let me ask you a question, a little sidebar. How do these people imagine they're going to escape the consequence of this? Or do they not think about it? This is the blind spot. This is the blind spot.

[01:12:32] Now, earlier in my life I was a devotee of the left hand path. But a very specific form of it. Um, in past, uh, lives, I have been a, a high priest of Cali in India. Well done that, that, but yet that is a very different way of achieving purity. And then there's other types of left-hand path practitioners, uh, again, within the Abrahamic system.

[01:13:08] Yeah. That deals with things like demons and they follow teachings like using the goia and so on. Or maybe with voodoo following the noaa. Yeah. And, uh, there is a certain level of ecstasy, um, of euphoria that comes with wielding this kind of energy, or let's say power. The power over life or death or power of, uh, causing change in the world in accordance to one's will again, quote unquote from the Satanic Bible.

[01:13:42] Yeah. And that ecstasy, it's like, it's like being high on a drug. Yeah. And, uh, you can see people that are high on drugs make rash decision, but when they come down or are sober again, they really, really, um, feel sorry about, remorseful, about, but that's the answer. Not in their right state of mind. Yeah.

[01:14:06] They're in a, of, uh, being hyped up, enjoying the process, right? Yes. Uh, you look at, say for example, uh, dark phases in our history where we've got, uh, concentration camps in World War ii and the guards inflicting the most, uh, horrible cruelty on people. Yeah. And these guys enjoyed it. Yes. Right. They really got off on it.

[01:14:31] Absolutely. And so in, in, in that state, there is no thought about cause and effect. Yeah. And, and, and to be honest, even in the left hand path, there's always this, uh, it's funny how I keep on going back to the Satanic Bible. That's an incredible document, by the way. Yeah. But there is no evil, but there's choices and their consequences.

[01:14:53] And then these people in that state of euphoria, neglect the consequences of actions, which is karma. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, um, I'm going to end, uh, for today. I'm gonna transcribe this and then condense it into its salient points and then we'll move on to a second interview. Um, so please try your best to move Andre in my direction.

[01:15:22] He's a critical I will do critical piece. Yeah. He's a Knight Rock or a bishop on the chess board. You know, he's not a pawn. We definitely need him. Yes. Uh, I'll, um, see, I think after I interact with him and, um, consents to him, um, quote unquote looking at my energy, it will put him at ease. Okay. So that state of cautiousness and anticipation of attack from left, right, and center.

[01:15:58] When he sees, uh, my intentions and my energy, uh, then he might be. Open to speaking his truth, although he has done so openly in many videos, he broadcast he's not afraid of speaking. Yeah. I think he very hesitant about who he trusts because people have been used to, um, basically get at him, try to hijack him and so on.

[01:16:26] So the one, one thing I, one, one thing I wanna touch on again before I let you go is how do you know that, uh, Laura Massey was the self-titled person?

[01:16:40] Um, well this was basically what David was saying. So it's, uh, from the horse's mouth. Okay. That, yes. Uh, Massie went on bragging to Andrew that yes, I'm now the official U c m Shamanic person, and this didn't really sit well with Andrew. Less than 24 hours later, the psychic attack happened and she was in hospital.

[01:17:09] Oh. Uh, so was this Andrew? Yeah. And, uh, then he pretended to be the one healing her, so really consolidating her loyalty to him. Okay. So the pattern is emerging. Can you, can you find, do you have access to the U C M videos?

[01:17:33] Um, is there something in particular you're looking for? I, I, I want that interview where she announced that she was the shaman person at U C M. Oh, no, no, this wasn't announced on a video. She told Andrew this, and, and Andrew went telling David. So, yeah, it's not, uh, it's not on any of the broadcasts. Okay.

[01:17:54] Wow. These guys are really dumb. I mean, they, they, they, they didn't factor in anything really. Um, they're really dumb. Bruce, I was, I was taken in. Yeah. I'm guilty of being dumb. Yeah. We, we sometimes have good intentions. We really don't do the due diligence or we see things that don't quite sit right and we just, uh, ignore it.

[01:18:20] I'm guilty of that too. Absolutely. All right. Let's thank you for your time, Amir. I'll, uh, I'll write this up in the next week. Okay. So you can read it and, um, I'll have follow up questions. Okay. Fantastic. Okay. Be well my friend. Oh, by the way, uh, by the way, um, please extend my offer to Eleanor. I did. I'm going to set.

[01:18:40] Okay. Excellent. Excellent. Very much. Okay. Be well. Yeah. Okay. Take care.
