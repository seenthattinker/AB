What we are seeing in the new age community are wolves pretending to be sheep,
evil people pretending to be saintly,  
hiding behind a psychic ability or some commiseration with negative or demonic forces. 
It's becoming a staple of our time,
the new age version of the pathetic piety of Jim and Tammy Faye Baker,
or the lascivious tendancies of Jimmy Swaggart, 
the evangelical preacher who was caught in cheap Texas motels with twenty dollar crack whores on more than one occasion,  
but where the Christian religious fraud artists seem to be only a liars, 
the new age fraud artist is something much darker.


## Non-Competition Non-Hierarchical Hypocrisy

It's an absurd irony that the top line material in Bartzis's published spiritual philosophy is non-hierarchy and non-competition.
He's completely hierarchical, 
and he has to be sitting at the top of the pyramid, 
and he's so competitive,
driven by his cupidity,
that his behavior has crossed into the criminal.
I would later learn,
talking to people for research on this story,
that one of the reasons he constantly needed money was that he liked cocaine. 
After talking to countless people about the galactic historian I suspect he liked all pleasures of the flesh and mind. 

He builds his coursework as _Living the Mystical Life Daily_. 
It was a point of contention that I didn't do any of his revocations or any of his courses. 
He reminded me at least fifteen times. 
I had no interest in his course material. 
The spiritual courses of Andrew Bartzis are not worth anybody's time. 
At most you're going to jack up a psychic center and be imbalanced for a while,
or worse.
When you're looking at spiritual teachings always look at the teacher. 
Ask yourself if that's what you want to be. 
If the answer is yes then do as you're told. 
If the answer is no then ignore everything they say.
The only reason I engaged with Andrew Bartzis was to round off my trilogy of books. 
In that regard he fulfilled his purpose. 
I do recommend the book, 
even though he doesn't give me royalties anymore and has literally stolen it.


It is the best of Andrew Bartzis,
and it was written by me so it was written in a balanced and loving way. 
I even managed to find a beauty in the work and a storyline throughout the whole 80,000 words. 
Bartzis himself has about as much beauty and grace as the output of a database. 
The absence of beauty in his perspective and himself was one of the first things I noticed. 
Highly evolved people always have this tremendous grace and beauty about them, 
and they are capable of seeing beauty all around them. 
When you listen to them speak everything gets elevated into the unified force of beauty. 
I knew right from the beginning Bartzis was no spiritual master. 
I knew he was a Barnum Bailey Circus sideshow freak with an uncanny ability to read the akashic records,
but that's all I needed to finish the trilogy. 

I'm very puritanical in the use of language. 
The word mystical derives from mystic. 
A mystic is one with direct communion with God. 
A psychic is not a mystic. 
All the major intelligence agencies of the world have psychics and they kill people. 
Does that sound mystical to you? 
There's nothing mystical about Andrew's teachings. 
He habitually refers to God as source, 
a neutral and unloving word that denotes no relationship of affection and intimacy. 
When in doubt follow the language. 
People always give themselves away in their language. 
No amount of neuro linguistic training can hide it from a language adept,
and that about sums up everything that's wrong with this new age nonsense masquerading as spiritual guidance. 
Bartzis is at the top of this heap of rubbish and lies.


What I was unprepared for was how dark he truly is. 
It's the recognition of that darkness that has prompted this article, 
this investigation,
and this disclosure.
There was a long line of people looking to get something off their chest about dealings they'd had with Bartzis.
To tell this story properly I have to go back a number of years.
