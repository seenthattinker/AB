# TalkingStickShow - Remembering John Edmonds &amp; Stardust ranch with Bruce Macdonald, Laura &amp; Maty

[00:00:00] Hello everyone and welcome back to the Talking Stick Show. So I'd like to welcome back this week again, coming on for the second time. Bruce McDonald. Hello Bruce. Hi Dale. Thank you for having me back. Hi Laura. Hi Mattie, for coming back on and we have special co-host Laura and Matthew. Hello Laura. Hi Dale.

[00:00:40] Hi guys. Hello, Matthew. Hi, everyone. River. And so, Laura, do you want to quickly, do you want to share the story you, you told me about the stone at the start and your experiences of what happened in the last week? If it's something you'd want to share with the, uh, when you'd went to the, uh, was it the cranial stuff?

[00:01:02] You know this about the Yes. Remind me. Yes. So you message me talking about you did the, is it the somatic release? Steph? And I kept, I kept thinking it would be great for you to speak about that on the show. So do you wanna speak about what you've been doing in the last few weeks on that? Yeah, yeah.

[00:01:19] Happily. Sorry. Yeah, absolutely. So, um, I've just done the fourth module of up Ledger sacral therapy, which is called, um, S E R. It's a somato release, so it's a body emotional release. So we were lucky enough to have a guy over from U S A who has worked with Dr. John Up Ledger. Um, the pioneer really, of cranial sacral therapy.

[00:01:48] He's worked with him since the beginning. So this guy brings an absolute wealth of knowledge and we were a fairly small group and, um, I was very, very lucky because it's not often you get to, um, one work with somebody with that amount of ability and experience or receive, um, a treatment from them. So, because everybody in the group wants a treatment with him, he said, you need to pick a number between one and 12.

[00:02:22] I'll write it down and then you go round and tell me what number you've picked. Well, I picked seven, which was what he had written down. Yes, I've got it. Which was, uh, which was great. Um, we'd already talked a little about, about two feathers medicine and shamanic practices, which he was very interested in and very receptive to all that.

[00:02:45] So it was great. So yeah, so I went on the table with, um, a training assistant. Um, who I chose, who I've done a lot of work with before, and, um, quite often it's, it is a lot of trauma release, but I have done, obviously on my self mastery journey working, uh, mostly with Andrew. I've done a lot of, of this work, so mine was, I, I was beaming just from it to it.

[00:03:12] I was so happy because I was, went immediately to a situation where I was coming to Earth and I had, I was a 40 million year old rock. So this, I love it. I was, I was like, I've gotta ask her about it. It's really cool. I'm a 40 million year old rock. And I, and he was saying that, you know, how many incarnations or they, they're very good at asking, well, this is what we are, talk, you are good at asking the questions, um, to actually enable you to release something that you need to release.

[00:03:49] And all I was re releasing really was a great deal of joy and I was shaking. I did a little bit of releasing people, release trauma in different ways. I tend to shutter. Um, whether that was trauma or excitement, I'm not really sure. And I really, it was like going on a journey. I just went through space and, um, he was asking questions and I said, well, I've had millions and millions of lives and it's my turn to come to earth.

[00:04:16] And it was just like he and the ta, the training assistant were my. Guides and guardians putting me through the golden tube to come through the sun, Paul to earth. So I think this completely, completely astounded him and possibly the class. But um, I was very lucky to have that experience with him. And he actually, because he, um, part of s e r is you study, um, it's really psychos spirituality, um, psychology, um, he went away and looked up, um, one of Carl Young's um, phrases and I think it's something about, I don't know exactly, so don't quote me on it, but it's something about we've all been rocks and plants before we came to earth so that because he likes young, that actually qualified it for him as well.

[00:05:12] So that was, yeah, that really was a tremendous experience and I was very privileged to have that and to be there. And here I am. You're and, and how are the, how's things with the tooth feathers medicine then Mattie and Laura? Uh, how's the creation going on there, Mattie? We're getting there. We're getting there.

[00:05:32] We just have to learn a whole new language. So it's been a learning curve. It's been great. Yeah, it's actually almost like, um, our self mastery process has moved away from the rituals and ceremonies to technological learning. So it's all a part and parcel of it. It really is. It's been a great journey, but we're excited.

[00:05:49] We're getting close to release now, so we're ready to release some videos and stop producing content and, um, the website will be up and running within a couple of weeks, hopefully. Fingers crossed. Beautiful brother, exciting time. But it's a journey, as Matt said, and we started with ebook, um, and that became a journey.

[00:06:08] And that was something, you know, encouraged by Bruce as well, because at the turn of last year, we were looking at doing something with Bruce, and then we all sort of went our separate ways. And then Mattie and I came together and thought, no, actually Bruce's idea of us doing a book is a good one changed, changed the idea that Bruce had.

[00:06:30] But um, we actually figured, no, this is something we can go forward and do because I so enjoyed, um, contributing to galactic history. So let, let me ask you guys, what do you think of writing as a spiritual process in practice? Well, for me it was very much like the same as when I created videos Recently, I didn't release some, I I, I did a big cleanse over the, over the summer solstice and I recorded the whole thing, seven days of ceremony and it all went awry.

[00:07:01] Near the end. I got sick and it was interesting to watch, but as I met editing the videos and I'm watching myself back, I could see body language that I know that I'm doing as I'm moving, but I dunno what it looks like. And it was really interesting to see the way I look and the way I appear and the way my voice is.

[00:07:17] And I found the same with writing. I found that my inner dialogue came out more, if that makes sense. Yes. And my inner dialogue is way more, um, I dunno the right word, instinctive. There's less barriers. So it just flows. There's nothing in between, there's no other person's receiving. It's just me giving out that which, which is, which is, which is flowing from me, if that makes sense.

[00:07:43] It was pure. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Dale, Laura. Yeah. Starting the book for me was the start of yet another spiritual journey as, as you're saying, because it then went into a lot of research and trying to use my own linguistics, not just repeating Andrews, although I've since learned from him that he's really happy if we do use his linguistics because of course they carry the frequency of the word he's putting out.

[00:08:14] Um, mine led to a dream where I actually. I met two feathers as in my guide as in a voice, but we had a long conversation and a dream I could finally remember. And he was overjoyed about the book. And so when it came to, what should we call the book? It was Two Feathers Medicine, and then he gave me what the world needs to heal.

[00:08:38] So that's what I'm using as the sort of the strap line. And then I find when I go, I've got a campervan, as you know. So I've started to go away on my own and it seems to be when I do my best writing, and it won't necessarily, there's nothing sequential I've done in the book at all. I have an idea, something, I wrote something recently about the myth of bury.

[00:09:04] Um, as a spiritual place, and it's quite punchy. Um, and I wrote it because I'd been there and had a negative experience, which is something we might do on one of our shows. Actually, there isn't it? Or maybe anyway. Um, yeah, so, and then, oh my goodness, and then I then, uh, I started two. It took me on a journey of research and I, the one person I found that Andrew recommended, that actually I feel is delivering some sort of truth because he's been researching for 40 years as Michael Taan.

[00:09:40] Yes. And I was bold, absolutely bold over listening to him. Yes. So, um, because I'm doing a camper band trip for three weeks to Scotland and the Outer HIEs, I particularly wanna read up on his Atlantis because he's talking about the accuracy of the standing stones in that part of the world, and there's so, so much more there.

[00:10:03] So I'm off on, look already, I'm off on another tangent writing. Oh no, it's not, not taught. It's great. That's what, that's what writing does. It takes you on journey. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And, and the question for you, Bruce, so. From listening and hearing about people's experience of writing books. So say your creativity, does it, is it kind of come through, I'd say at will or is it kind of times where you'll be like, right, I've got a bit of a writer's block.

[00:10:32] What's that like for you? Is, is write a writer's block a big thing, um, for you, Bruce? No, no, never. Never had it. I've never been really, I mean, I have felt like a little uninspired at times. Like I'm, you know, I'm, I'm not always working on a book. When I sit down to work on a book, I. I never get blocked, and there's a bunch, there's a bunch of little secrets that can pass on.

[00:10:55] So if you don't feel parti when you start writing, what happens is you just keep moving forward with however the story comes out. But if some days you'll wake up and you don't wanna move forward. Go back to the beginning and start your editing process. So you do editing and writing simultaneously, and when you're editing, you're just sort of like preparing the ground for the next wave of energy and your story to come and, and so on and so forth.

[00:11:21] And trying to understand your story a lot better. Writing remains one of the great mysteries for me. I mean, to this day, I don't really have any sense of where it comes from. Um, you get a lot of help when you're writing. Um, all writers say the same thing whether they're on, whether they're on a path or not.

[00:11:38] They, I, we don't know where it comes from. I just saw the exact same thing from a little meme on the Inta. You know, a quote from Douglas Adams who write Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and he said, look, basically, look, people ask me all the time where these books came from. I'm gonna join the chorus of all my ancestor writers.

[00:11:56] I don't know. And, but it's a, it's a beautiful process because if you knew it wouldn't be as much fun. I think that's the whole point of creativity as it happens in the moment, right? Yes. And you don't, you don't really know where it's coming from. Michael Jackson has to say that if he, if he's, if a song came in, he'd have to get it down quickly before Prince got it.

[00:12:19] Yeah. I, I remember that, that was brilliant.

[00:12:25] And, and talking of, of books and writing. Let's, uh, our last show we were gonna talk about Status Ranch, but we didn't actually get ta get round to doing it. That was, so let's talk about the Great John Edmonds and Starters Ranch then. Um, and I think to start with some content, uh, would be to talk about the difference between a gray and the difference between, say, a Syrian or Aian or anything like that.

[00:12:50] Cause a lot of people don't know the difference between grays or the difference between. A being who has a tree of life. So, does anybody wanna start with that before we go into the, into the story more? I, I'll, I'll have one thing to say about that. And the truth is that you can never completely really know what you're dealing with because one could appear as the other and the other could appear as the other.

[00:13:09] Yes. And, you know, and, and just because someone's plate and doesn't mean they're not an asshole, you know, uh, it, it just, as much as you take every person on the planet earth, you can't put us all into a same box and say, is a good person, a bad person, or this person, or that person? And it, you know, with those guys, you just amplify that, you know, so you never know really what you're dealing with.

[00:13:31] The interesting thing that I've built, we'll, just hearing the small bits that, that I have is that for some reason on that property, they weren't coming in cloaked, were they? They were coming in as they are and coming in close and personal as well. You know, because usually they use mind, like really excessive mind control.

[00:13:49] And even the good ones will do that when they come up to a being. They all trying their mind to a certain element, you know? But this guy had none of that, did he? Bruce? No. No. So, um, well, I'll, I'll tell you what, what John told me and um, And then I'll tell you, you know, some of my experiences, because when I worked with John, there was a lot of, some kind of a psychic link was created between the two of us.

[00:14:14] And a lot of the stuff that was happening at the ranch started in a smaller degree happening where I live here, um, in the Taliman Mountains in Sal Costa Rica. Um, and I mean, when I say stuff started happening here, I mean, you know, my, my wife was aware of it. Like, you know, it was, it was really quite an experience.

[00:14:36] Um, so the grays, um, that are at, uh, John's ranch, um, I, I don't think they were really a race per se. I think what they were, uh, or part of what they were was a suit you can get into on the fourth dimension to come into earth and have an experience. And p and there's, there are vendors selling this on the other side, just like we would get in line to go on a roller coaster.

[00:15:07] Mm-hmm. You know, and, and so that was part of it. Um, there's a lot of stuff that didn't make it into the book. And there's some stuff, even, even now after John's passing and we finished the book, December 30, released the book December 31st, 2019. There's even, even to this day, um, there's stuff I don't feel entirely comfortable talking about.

[00:15:34] Maybe today you guys will crack my walnut and it'll come out, but, um, it's just so weird. I don't, I, maybe I should just say it and, and you guys make a bit what you will. Okay. Because this is, okay. So this is, this is the full, thank you. So this is, This is, this is I, I believe I have John's permission to say these things.

[00:16:00] And you know, when you pick up Stardust Ranch and you read it, we wrote it in a way that, okay, this is a U F O experience and this is the experience of one man and his wife on this ranch. Okay. But really there's a lot more to John that we decided to keep out of the book because we didn't want to confuse people too much.

[00:16:19] John John is a first generation super soldier and one of the best they ever produced, okay? One of the best they ever produced in that first generation. And he became a kind of a mentor to a lot of the next generation of super soldiers. Super soldiers usually don't live as long as John Edmonds live, most of them.

[00:16:38] Um, They, they die in their forties or fifties or, you know, they don't make it as long as John did. So, number one, John was a super soldier. Which raises the question, was he placed on Stardust Ranch as a guardian, a sentinel for, for the defense force of the United States? Or did, or did he actually randomly just find that ranch?

[00:16:59] Well, he, he never really answered that question for me, or I didn't have the balls to ask him. John was a bit scary. Yeah, ied, I was gonna say something like that. I was like, he's, when I was reading, I was like, wow, I, I would love to have met John. Like, geez, e E meets the Hell's Angels, is how I describe it.

[00:17:21] You know, and, um, I love when he, when he said, um, fear, he just doesn't have any fear or gets worried about anything. He just doesn't seem to have that in him. He, he didn't, you know, he did not, John did not know what fear was. Okay. So it was like a kind of emotional leprosy for John. He just didn't feel fear, you know, and, and, um, which was an, it's an incredible quality in a human being.

[00:17:48] He felt tremendous sadness. I think what hurt him the most was, you know, what happened to his wife on the ranch, you know, she, she had a lot there. There's a radiation sickness that people get when they're exposed to some of these extraterrestrials. So for the people who say, this is all in people's head or there's, there's a rising crystal.

[00:18:08] Christian voice fighting back now saying, this is all demonology. We, you know, we need to engage these people peacefully and respectfully and come to a common understanding because this is knowledge the human race has to get right. This is, this is foundational tribal knowledge, like the, the, the basic multi-dimensional experience.

[00:18:27] And most of the east ET stuff is just fourth dimensional, so it's really elementary and people have to get this right. And, but by the way, that was kind of the philosophy we roast a stardust ranch with, which is why it's such a different kind of ET book. It doesn't read like any of the other books. And then everybody, as soon as that book came out, everybody changed their tune.

[00:18:50] Uh, you know, uh, Steven Greer started doing con uh, close encounters five direct consciousness contact with ex extraterrestrials. Well, John and I explained in that, in that book how 99% of people who have an ETR experience, it will be a consciousness experience, not a physical experience. Mm-hmm. And, and we ex and nobody was talking about this I in this context before we put the book out and then everything changed and nobody gave John credit for, for that, which is fine.

[00:19:19] He wasn't a guy out there looking for credit or any, I'm sorry, Dale, what was the original question? Uh, so, so I think the, the first question they asked was just the difference between like, let's say the gray, where you get load of different, uh, spirits can go into that one machine and kind of drive it forward into this reality.

[00:19:39] So one, one of the great, another one of the great untold stories of Stardust Ranch, we get into it a little bit at the end, but not in any great detail. Is John's incredible experience with what we would call neutral or benig ets. I mean, we're talking about a guy who literally at his kitchen table in the physical had tea in conversations with seven or eight different races of ex.

[00:20:01] They used to come and visit him. He told me that the, he, he told me that the ranch put out a signal that was incredibly curious to anything passing within, I don't know, a few light years or anything. And they would detour almost like a Star Trek episode. They would de what is that? We've never seen that kind of signature before.

[00:20:20] What is that? And we, what it really was, I mean, we were all, none of us really knew completely including John what the ranch was. And then after I finished, um, galactic historian about, I think two months after we finished the book, I got a call from Andrew one day and he said, do you think you could arrange a meeting between myself and John Edmonds?

[00:20:41] And I said, Andrew, I don't, I don't think that's a good idea. And then, And then he persisted two or three times and I fi I finally arranged it. And j John doesn't, didn't like to be hijacked. He didn't, he didn't like to, um, you know, be forced to meet people. He was a very, very private person. He and Andrew be, ended up becoming the best of friends and, um, Andrew was a very, very positive, uh, experience for John, A very healing experience.

[00:21:13] But ultimately, what was going on at this ranch, which set it apart from the other ones? Yeah. Um, was, this was not just a dimensional portal, it was a time portal and it had been used extensively in the timeline wars. And there's even a timeline bunker under there. Okay, and, and so John had sort of been placed as the keeper there.

[00:21:34] Now, John was an exceptional human being, even aside from being the first generation super soldier, being the guy who lived on Stardust Ranch for 25 years, even at a genetic level before the government got ahold of him. He was an exceptional human being. Andrew described it to me this way. He said, Bruce, most human beings have one to 3% founder, d n a, um, John, John has about 25% founder, d n a.

[00:22:01] Mm-hmm. Right. He had this incredibly rigid body. It, it was almost like Wolverine from the X-Men. You know, Melissa gets into this when they, you know, when he finally was taken out, how hard it was for them. You know, he had seven ruptures in the widowmaker of valve and he was still le still, um, sorry. Um, some head hunter calling me for a tech writing contract.

[00:22:27] Um, so he, he, he, he was, um, he, he, he was an exceptional human being in that regard too. John was fully psychic. Like a, A as psychic as Andrew. Yeah. John John could walk. Right. So the two times I start, I started the book in 2012, quit cuz I was a punk. I was a punk and a bitch and I quit cuz I got scared. Not afraid.

[00:22:52] I'm not afraid to admit that. Okay. I'm not afraid to. I'm not afraid to admit that at all. And, and it was really creepy. I was living in an apartment in Toronto and I, it was like the walls were closing in on me the first time I worked on that book. And, and, but John always felt I was the guy to write the book.

[00:23:12] By the way. He tried to write this book with three or four writers. Everybody quit halfway through. Yeah. One wo, one woman finished a manuscript, but she ended up being somebody's dog. She was on a leash. I won't get into that. It's a whole international story. Um, and, and, and, and he, he prohibited that book from being published.

[00:23:33] And there were a lot of foreign intelligence agencies interested in Stardust Ranch too, including the Chinese, the, the Chinese, Chinese intelligence wants Stardust Ranch. Yeah. So. Sorry guys. I get all excited. I forget the questions. I don't even we're talking about anymore. I've got got from all,

[00:23:53] so, so Matt and Laura, so what's your take in perspective of John and, and reading Status Ranch? We'll start with Matt. Oh, I, I, I, I've, I've had this kind of contact I've had, you know, um, I've had them come up to me in the street. Never had them in my kitchen. Well, not, not like, just, just, you know, without some sort of mind control going on, but, um, I had had 'em come up to the street, but I've had some strange stuff as well.

[00:24:19] You know, some, some bits where like wife would be pregnant for a little bit and then the pregnancy all of a sudden disappears. Um, I wake up strange marks on my body, or blue, bald, like crazy feeling like I've been going at it all night. I remember once waking up, just coming through my ceiling and landing down on my bed, you know, and I, I've all kinds of crazy shit.

[00:24:39] And one thing that. People don't really expect is that when you enter into one of these moments, when you suddenly realize what's going on, the adrenaline will kick in. Yeah. And the adrenaline will kick in. And as much as you could be one of these people who's asking for contact, asking for contact, that's what I was doing.

[00:24:57] And when they actually landed and then came to pick us up, my heart almost exploded out my body, you know, almost collapsed on the floor, honestly. And then all of a sudden we had was like, like that. And, but this guy, this guy was, this guy was waking up with a rather horrific looking, being in his room, and then he just killed it.

[00:25:18] Killed him. You know? Yeah. And like the bravery that that would've took to do that, most people would've froze an an ounce of fear. And these beings can totally manipulate you. Yeah. Yeah. He must have been this war of just, Nope. Hello. So what we're interested in, Bruce, any stories you've got that haven't made it into the book?

[00:25:36] Maybe some things that, some things, some things that are unique. They don't have to be grotesque or, or, you know, risky, but just unique. Okay. I'll, I'll, uh, I'm gonna tell you something now that like this has never come up anywhere in the ET material or anything, and this is the perfect group to tell it to.

[00:25:55] And I want to get what you guys think of this. Okay. So John would go through phases where he would become the predator, not the prey. Okay. And he had ways of drawing out the graves. And one of the ways that he would draw them out and, um, bring them into the world and make them accessible to him if he wanted to kill them or whatever, is, I'm really uncomfortable saying this out loud.

[00:26:25] He, he would, he would do blood smears around a house of menstrual blood. Right. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that works. So, and, and, and I, I remember when he told me that, I said, man, that's not going in the book.

[00:26:44] Can't teach people kind of magic. You can't teach the magic. It's irresponsible. But if you know it and there's a reason behind it, and you, you, you, you know, you then, whatever, you know. Well, and yet Bruce, and yet no problem writing about Blood of the Month in Gods and Economist. Well, yeah, we, we can Thank you for, covered that one quite well.

[00:27:09] Thank you for con thank you for continuing. To listen to that book, Laura, I'd love hit your opinion. Monty Dean is finishing up the edit. I've done the edit on the paper back. So we're, I'm gonna re-release that book under its new title, and this is a pre edited version that, that I went back to because I think my editing house in my publishing house in Canada made changes.

[00:27:32] Yeah, that's a really, really, really interesting chapter in that book. Wait, wait till you get to Devil Woman. Okay. I have Okay. All right. Saying nothing that is even more interesting. But yes, it brings all this to mind. Um, with what I know the title for, I know the title for this video. Now Menstrual attracts Grace.

[00:27:57] Please, I'm not, not do that. Please don't do that. What, what was your view on reading it in your experience with, uh, John Edmonds? Blown away. I don't think there can be anything out there like this that gives such a firsthand, well-written account of so much stuff that is absolutely must be irrefutable.

[00:28:29] What, what has happened and the bravery both he and Joyce have shown and he's, what I really love about John Edmonds, and I'm gonna talk about him in the present tense because he is such a great being. He is doing some great work on another dimension, so I'm absolutely sure, and maybe Bruce can, you know, fill more on that.

[00:28:54] Yeah, yeah. But he, he fought quite rightly to protect his wife and to protect what was his. And he dealt with it in some ways no different than if there were a bunch of, um, you know, people assassins coming to take over his home. He, he seemed to very, despite how this would floor most people, he very quickly seemed to sort himself out into what he needed to do and how he needed.

[00:29:24] He, he worked out what he needed to do to, um, deal with them. Let's say, I don't want to give too much away for people who haven't read the book. I actually had it on audio and that's fantastic because Monty is such a good narrator. Um, so I, yeah, it is d I don't wanna to say too much, but just the bravery, the tenacity he showed to stand his ground, and that's his piece of.

[00:29:56] Space time, reality. You know, he's, he's fighting for what is his, he's fighting for his bit of earth and you to totally understand why he did what he did. Yeah, and I just, I was wondering, Bruce, how much things, programs like the X-Files and Men in Black aided people in believing John's story or whether that worked against what you were trying to do?

[00:30:26] Because it can work both ways, can't it? That is, that is an excellent, um, Excellent, excellent question, Laura. Now, I wasn't, I wasn't a huge fan of the X-Files. I've never been like a sci-fi guy or I, and I've never been an ET guy despite being the author of Stardust Ranch. You know, I've had my own ET experiences beginning at 10 years old.

[00:30:46] All my ETR experiences are witnessed, they're all fully awake, walking around, and somebody is with me of, of a nons susceptible mindset. It, it's, it's al it's almost like when I have an ET experience. I'll ha the, the second one happened when I was about 37. I had come back from a 12 week, uh, retreat in a cabin that had no electricity.

[00:31:07] I ate one meal a day. I fasted for 12 weeks, and I was working on a novel and praying and meditating, and I got all charged up. And I came home and I was leaving the house with one of my roommates at the time, and he was 10 years older than me, and he was the crusties, standup comedian you've ever, he'd been a standup comedian for 25 years.

[00:31:25] He, it's all the, and, and he just like real cemented. Okay. And we see this, the light and everything. He goes, that was an et. I said, what else could it be? And then we, we talked about it for two months. The other one, when I was, the other really noticeable one, which, uh, a little gr uh, sort of Palladian disc that was with my brother that was outside of Ottawa, coming back from the family cottage.

[00:31:47] And we were both sitting knees up with our arms like this on back shelf of a Volkswagen bug, looking out the back window. And we saw the little Palladian disc floating off in the side, in, in the woods. And my brother and I, we looked at each other like this really weird experience. I get home for a, a, um, A family Christmas when I was about, uh, I think this is when I was going to university, so I was about, uh, 25 years old.

[00:32:12] I, I started a bit late on my program in university. I took, I never finished high school and I, I, I was living in Toronto. I went home for Christmas. And when I, you know, I got off the bus and I, I grabbed a cab. I came home, I came through the front door and they were already at the Christmas, Christmas dinner table or two days before Christmas, but my family was eating at the dining room and they were giving my brother a super hard time.

[00:32:35] And my brother is like, total like non-ag. He's a chartered financial analyst. He golfs, he like, there's no, none of this kind of imagination in him. And he had, he had told my parents and my sister the U f O story and they were mocking them. And I walk in the door, I go, yeah, that a hundred percent that happened.

[00:32:52] And, and um, yeah, so I had to validate my brother there, but I'm sorry, Dale, what was the question again? It was it my question about yes, it was black. D does soft disclosure films, are they soft disclosure or is that Unfortunately Chris Carter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I always, I always wonder where Chris Carter came from.

[00:33:18] You know, for those listening who don't know, he's, he's the founder and principal writer of the X-Files. He did one subsequent season called Millennium. And, um, it, it didn't pan out as well, but I, I think, yeah, he did work with people. I think he was given files he would access. I think this happens quite a bit.

[00:33:37] I think they opened up some material for Steven Spielberg for Close Encounters of the Third kind. And in their own way, they kind of want to get the information out Right. Um, so whether Chris Carter, uh, affected things or not, I don't know. I would, I would, I would say probably the, the, the bigger influence, um, was probably the writer, Whitley Whitley Streiber, um, who ended up, you know, making that movie that, uh, Chris, Chris walk and ended up in, I think he was a much bigger influence on Experiencers and stuff like that.

[00:34:11] So, um, I remember, you know, talking to, um, John Edmonds about the X-Files and, you know, he, he was quite critical, you know, uh, it's kind of like. Before we started the show, Mattie was telling a story about his dad, about being book read, but experientially lacking. Well, that's when you, when you went into a critique of these shows in a Skype call with John Edmonds, it was like the ultimate experiencer, right?

[00:34:37] So he would, mm-hmm. Oh, they got this right. They got this wrong. They got this right now. John also had this effect in the general ET community. They, they were terrified of him and they didn't like him that much. He, he wasn't welcome at MFA and all these, all these big conferences where people make their annual income, right?

[00:34:55] All of these so-called pundits and experts speaking on the ET movement, very few of them have that much experience. You know, and, and there's, there's some that just focus on physical data. I can't remember the fellow's name, but he's got a PhD. He was an academic before he became a publisher in the U f o Rich Dolan, you know, so he, he, he writes a lot about, you know, um, military aircraft and how they were influenced by acquisitions from, let's say this ET world and stuff like that.

[00:35:24] But at the level of pure experience, you know, except for a few pe I think John was probably the most experienced person on the planet with ets, you know, beyond, beyond Alex Collier, beyond any of them. I mean, Alex Co Collier was basically just an Andrew Meen, contactee John. I mean, some of the stories is I, some of the stories to this day, I still find difficult to believe some of the stuff that John told me, right?

[00:35:50] So, obviously the most magnificent. If you've read the story, the most incredible thing and, and the one that was witnessed by everybody was, was when Brandy showed up to try and clean the house with the two Syrians and what went down the purple lightning and everything. Yeah. You know, and you remember, you remember the police, so the police services all in Arizona, Mari Maricopa County Sheriff's Department, they, they all know this stuff is real and they have a policy when people call about this stuff and they insist that an officer be sent, they basically have this policy where the officer shows up and gaslights you.

[00:36:30] Yeah. Imagine trying to do that to John Edmonds. Yeah. You know, so, hey, you know, and he, he would, he would notice as soon as the cops would show up, he'd say, he'd say, Hey, your badge isn't on your hat and it isn't on your chest. Why have you taken off all your identifying material, sir, we just have your, your report will be written up, but I just don't want to be identified with this.

[00:36:56] I, I want to keep my job, you. So, uh, why, why we started talking about this stuff and the way we did in the eighties with Chris Carter and a few other things. I don't know, I think you guys might even be better qualified to, to answer that question than me, but it really did start in the eighties and nineties, right?

[00:37:19] Where this really became a huge public topic. What, what are your guys' thoughts? What was it about the timeline and the human timeline that this information needed to start coming into human consciousness? I dunno about that. I, I think a lot, I think a lot of, um, a lot of it was negative. You know, most, most of the narrative is negative, isn't it?

[00:37:39] And for some reason there was, I mean, there, there are films I can name here and there, but most of it's just bologna. You know, it's, it's, it's just, it's. And they never really addressed. And this goes through their X-Files as well. They never really addressed the multidimensional aspect of it because they don't just turn up and you talk and then off they go and then, you know, there's always a dialogue going.

[00:37:59] There's dreams, there's, there's all this other stuff that goes on the way they communicate in the unseen worlds, the way they exist, you know, fully multi-dimensionally and they, they address you on that level and they, they don't seem to include any of this in these kind of, uh, films. I thought Capax was great.

[00:38:15] Yeah. Um, I thought that that addressed that, that aspect of it. And it would look ridiculous to someone who hadn't experienced you see, cuz you could crazy laugh at that movie, but if you've experienced you'd get it completely. There are a few others as well, but yeah, most of it's just lacking the real depth of what it actually means.

[00:38:30] Multidimensionality, they're getting close now though. There was, there was a period in the nineties, I remember one of the first U f O films I watched scared the shit out of me about extraterrestrials. It was like, you know, the Blair Witch Project put an alien film. It's like was done on camera. And there was this alien, and I think this like green laser got short got shown.

[00:38:50] And from then I was terrified. So when I got to about, when the internet came first came out, I had my little tiny computer and I was just researching about them and looking into them. And what I kind of got was the nineties period with those shit loads of people being abducted. And there were so many different stories out there throughout the nineties of people being taken, very people losing time.

[00:39:11] Um, and I'm not really sure, I've not really seen much now of, of that and, and recent experience. And I think John's experience is one of the most recent which I've heard. What about yourself, Laura and, and Matt?

[00:39:27] And that? I just, I wouldn't watch one after Aliens, but I was a lot younger than Signs. That was a good one. I, I loved that. Um, yeah, particularly asked about men in Black, um, bearing in mind what he witnessed. With the guys who came to two guys who visited him. Not saying anymore, not wanting to give more away, but I wondered whether the film came out afterwards because it might, you know, it was a funny film so it might have worked against, um, what he was trying to, um, he was, he was letting people know had actually happened.

[00:40:07] So yeah. I just wondered cuz there's obviously some correlation there. Um, I think Jo John mentioned in the book that the men in black ha that experience he had was before the Men in Black then, right? Yeah, I think, I think he mentioned that in the book. Yeah. Oh, it was, sorry. No, it might have been a radio show.

[00:40:23] The first time I, I heard John was Bruce and, uh, John on a radio show, and I think he mentioned it there that it was actually before his experience of the Men in Black was before when the film was created. Is that right, Bruce? Oh, oh, I, I, well, When was the first one with, uh, Tommy Lee Jones And Will Smith, when was he the first men in Black?

[00:40:45] So John? Yeah. J it might have been around the same time, but I mean, John, John had, uh, extensive experience with the men in Black. It wasn't just the ones we documented in the book. Um, there were, I I suspected earlier, later, earlier in John's life, in his early twenties or mid twenties, he was probably a approached by the physical representation for this group or this league to become a men in black.

[00:41:09] There's, there are humans participating in this as well. I'm not quite sure what all their function was. I think John withheld certain things, quite frankly, to protect me. I, I, I re, you know, he, he, he could read me completely and um, And I think he withheld some stuff. Um, I, I maybe just form there. There's certain things that's dangerous to know.

[00:41:29] I mean, if you discover them on your own, that that's okay, but if it's passed through communication, it's, it may, it might, it might break some oath or promise he had made in his developmental years going through these programs that made him, um, a super soldier and, and they police these programs and the underlying contracts quite, quite vigorously.

[00:41:50] Quite, quite, quite vigorous. Might karma as well, Bruce. Huh? I'm sorry, one more time. So you might inquire some karma as well, you know, if you're giving people this information and they go out and misuse it, it's not just, whoops, it's, you know, it's on you in, in, in different ways. Absolut. Absolutely.

[00:42:08] Absolutely. Yeah. He didn't talk about, um, in the book, he didn't talk about his actually experience of being abducted. He didn't want to share that, did he? And, um, yes, and I'm, I've heard a lot of other stories about abductions and some of them are really, really dark, and so I, I totally understand why he didn't want to share some of the stories.

[00:42:28] Yeah. Did he have any really positive ones? Did he have any good friendships? Because I've, I've, I've met some of twos that are absolutely great people. Yeah. We must have had some friendship. John, John had really good Andrew Meen and really good pla friends. And so there's a number of pla incarnate on the planet too, or, or some of them come through.

[00:42:48] I have to, I have to learn to shut my mouth a little bit. Sometimes I say things, say things that maybe shouldn't be in the public space, but, well, we are talking about war down, so there are. Yeah, so there are, there are a number, number of portals on the earth that you, you just, with a walking guide, you can go and you can go to another planet or people can come from other planets.

[00:43:07] So, you know, the ETS have always been here, you know, and the, the, oh, let's go back to Chris Carter and everything. I, you know, one of the things that ours should be, are doing. One of the things that the powers that B are doing is they're trying to cultivate a narrative that suggests the ETS are coming to visit us now.

[00:43:28] Obfuscating the narrative that they've always been here and really been, you know, management in the farm system and, um, the ones that visit and don't interfere just to look at what's happening here as part of the karmic process and don't see it as, as horrible or anything like that. I don't see it as horrible anymore.

[00:43:46] I don't see this, I don't see this planet no, in, in, in a very negative way. Although everybody I've worked with who ha you know, has told me, well, it's a hot house. It's a, it's a greenhouse. The grow genetics, they harvest psych energy, lush or whatever. Still, it's so beautiful here. It, uh, you know, and it's just incredible this planet, I think, and I don't let these things bother me that much, but, uh, yeah, and it come, it comes around again, doesn't it?

[00:44:12] To the lore of the universe. What you look at looks back at you, and if you do go into that rabbit hole of. Seeing all this information, but all you're doing is reading information like the negative stuff. Your life is going to be negative. And like Andrew talks about the neutral teachings, and that's for me the cons.

[00:44:29] I don't really read much into it, but now, and then I'll have a look, but I make sure I don't put my effort and energy into that because my reality completely changes. So the, the, the, the truth side came to, with all of this stuff, this, let's call it some negative fourth dimensional stuff and, and a little bit above the fourth dimension too.

[00:44:47] And you, you, you, you can throw, you know, malignant dead human beings in, you can throw demons in, you can throw negative extraterrestrials in and Earth. Yep. Yes, absolutely. Inner earth as well. The way, the way I balanced it all out and, and came to peace with it was there, there, there, there really is a. A way to look at it where it all makes sense, right?

[00:45:11] So what you gotta do is you gotta apply the law of economy to it. And the law of economy is like, well what is the economy and what is the necessity? Now they created maybe a bad karmic situation where they, some of these fourth dimensional entities, they need to rob energy from the third dimension to survive it.

[00:45:30] It's kind of like a crackhead stealing your tv. You know, do you really? He's an addict. You know, it would be great if he could go do an IGA igan ceremony and get over his crack addiction, but he hasn't done that yet. And you know, can't I? You can't get angry. You can't get upset. It just, it happened, right?

[00:45:47] And that's how I came to see a lot of these things, is that there's, in this planet we live in, there's a lot of things around us that are still existing, but need to maintain an, an economic or an energetic economy with a third dimension to survive. This is also the explanation for the lush harvesting as well.

[00:46:03] There's, there's whole worlds out there that can't generate their own energy to sustain themselves. So they have to come and farm psychic energy here to sustain bubble reality. They're living in. So this is, this is how I came to understand it. And it was a, when I understood it through this economic lens, there was a tremendous amount of forgiveness and understanding.

[00:46:23] And it, it, it's just like, oh, the poor bastard man. Like the crack addict. Oh you poor bastard. You know, I really hope you can get out of this. And until that time I guess you're gonna be boosting TVs. You know? So for that perspective, I find it really exciting. That's what I find it, because when I stand outside of my house and I can see the ships flow over a lot of time, they'll make themselves known, you know?

[00:46:46] Um, yeah. And I'm standing there and I'm looking at it and I'm thinking about all the stuff that's going on underneath my feet, all the commerce and the bits of bobs, all the energy that's moving around me. Then when out there, all the traffic that's moving, that comes from our planet, all the spaceships coming out, coming back in, all the different, cause there's more traffic going and out there from these guys than what we've got.

[00:47:04] And we are living in this little pony show that everyone believes in this little play. And so I'm just standing here looking out, actually aware of all of this that's going on and seeing it happening. Little bits and bobs of it and you know, and just. It'd be in awe of the whole thing, actually. At least I know it.

[00:47:19] I'm down here. I know all about it, and I'm able to experience it from this perspective. You know, it does seem awful looking at them a lot, who just believe that's the totality of reality. Yeah, hold on. We're we're, we're some kind of spectacular galactic show this planet. We're like, they're driving it.

[00:47:37] This is like whatever. It's just whatever's going on here. A lot of, a lot of things are very interested in it and it there is, I. You know, so, uh, uh, anyways, I, I don't, I don't wanna hijack the process, uh, you guys, uh, uh, some knowledge you want to extract about startups. So I was gonna go in a different direction and talk about, you know, something new.

[00:48:01] I'm discovering living in the jungle here, which is like elementals, but, we'll, we'll, we'll save that for maybe another show next year or something. But what's your next question about Stardust Ranch? I would love, love to have your opinion. Well, everyone yours, Bruce, and everyone's about the Samurai sword, which just appeared off, off a truck on, on the, uh, he just literally came across a samurai sword, and then he had, was it, uh, was it the, uh, Brandy who came, came over and she had those swords?

[00:48:30] Was it those. And all of that correspond. What she view on that bruise? Were they real? Were they real? Were they real samurai swords? Like, like old antiques? It, it, it was, it was actually a, a real samurai sword. Whether it was made to the specifications of the samurai with the metal folding and, and the metal cleaning, getting the carbon out of it and everything, which is an un unbelievably artistic metallurgical process, the way they make those sorts.

[00:48:56] Whether it was authentic or not, I don't know. But it was a samurai sword. It was the same dimension, the same handle. And um, I, I suspect it was just some, you know, uh, lower, lower grade metal knockoff that you could probably buy for two or $300. Like a real samurai sword would be half million or more. Oh, they, they, they can be, they could be seated through time.

[00:49:16] You know, they can be put in the right hands at the right time. They time travel. Oh yeah, let's give him a samurai. It's not working. The samurai sword, the samurai sword will want the gray heads. It'll want the gray heads be like, yeah, I want that on my journey, man. Yeah. So the sword getting and, and then connecting it to brandy as everyone on this show knows the sword is the universal weapon, right?

[00:49:42] Mm-hmm. So it, it's the universal weapon of, of, of, let's say, I don't know what word I would use. The defenders or the righteous, or I, I, yeah. Phrase, yeah. Truth. Yeah. Oh true. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. My, my, yeah. Yeah. So, um, it was, it was very well served in John's hands, and, uh, you know what, that's gonna sound a bit opportunistic and maybe even a bit creepy given that he passed February 28th.

[00:50:11] But I wouldn't mind getting that sort.

[00:50:15] I, I, I'm actually gonna, after this show, I'm actually gonna send Joy some message. Like, what are your sword, imagine, imagine trying to get that through Costa Rica customs,

[00:50:30] it seems some unusual action that sword man. It'll be one day you can tuck that in a box and, and, and then one day it'll be worth a shit ton of money. Oh yeah. But just, just to have it as a little part of John and his legacy, but the universe found the right hands to put that sort in. I'll tell you. Yes.

[00:50:47] It's a great story. Yeah. Totally, and that's it. He, he felt for me, what attracted me to John specifically is frequency and the way he talked. I don't really watch many people. I watch Andrew, a few other teachers, and as soon as I heard him speaking, I heard his intent and I heard his philosophy about life and just how much likely say he was a super soldier, he was a warrior, and he knew that through and through.

[00:51:12] And for John it was just, this is the way kind of, this is the way, there's Nova way and stuff like that. And from reading the book and listening to how it corresponded with him learning about himself while he was there throughout the years and his correspondence of how it. Connected to kind of the culture and the reality of what we were going through.

[00:51:30] So for me, the pheromone of him speaking and talking, you could tell he just doesn't. There's no shit's given. And he is who he is and he's so authentic and that's what really I appreciate about him. He just says it how it fucking is. There's no sugar coating about it all. And he talks about the new age community of how he fucking hates it and all of that.

[00:51:51] All of this, this bullshit that I'm just like, yes, this guy's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, John. Yeah, he, he was absolutely incredible. Um, very, the, you know, that's the super tough side of John. He had a very worshipful side, a very prayer centric side, a very, very reverential and, um, ritual side, very much in keeping with, uh, Andrew's teachings.

[00:52:20] He, and he basically self-taught, you know, he, he learned how to do these rituals and balance himself. He knew about every, he knew about the power of water. He knew about the power of fire, the power of air, like everything. He, he had an incredible amount of teaching. Um, so he had a charmed life, right? From the very, well, geez, I should, no, I'm not sure it is charmed, but, um, he had a, a really extraordinary life right from the beginning.

[00:52:48] And, you know, one of the, my favorite things about. You know, knowing John and, and writing the book and talking to him, um, was a lot of the stuff that didn't end up in the book. Like, so in, in, in the seventies and eighties, John ran a promotion company that did, um, the setup for concerts in Chicago and other parts of the United States.

[00:53:11] I mean, he knew and partied with everybody, everybody. Jimmy Page, Jimmy Hendrix, Joan Bayer, everybody. Everybody. And you know what he told me? He told me in the rock and roll world, in, in, in, in like the roadies and the people around the bands, he said it was loaded with extraterrestrials. A lot of 'em were extraterrestrials.

[00:53:33] Hmm. You know, and, and it's just, it's these little things that like, only I, you know, there are two people who say things that hit me coming from such, I, I never expect what they're gonna say. Okay. And you know who the other one is? It's Andrew Baris, and the other one was John Edmonds. Like, and then you get the, you go, what the hell?

[00:53:53] And I'm thinking, is this true? And I'm going, well, who the hell could make this up? Wrote a lot of roadies or extra tourette. Who wouldn't make that up? Like, what would be the motive? It's got to be true. Right? Then go ahead. And then you hear more, more contactee as, as they begin to tell their stories as the world opens up and everything.

[00:54:14] A lot of people will tell you that, you know, when, when we talk about extraterrestrials in the human habit, we talk about, you know, Ben benign and malignant, good and bad, but there's a whole bunch of neutrals that come here just to have a sex drug and rock and roll experience. Yep. You know, like Planet, planet Earth is like, uh, it, it's like some ki some kind of nightclub for these people or something like this.

[00:54:39] Right? And there's an connection pizza. I, I, there's, there's something about, again, going back to the menstrual blood with the grays and everything, you know, there's something about the human sexual exchange and the energy in it that's very attractive to a lot of the ets. Yeah. You know, there, and, and I, I don't know how other races reproduce.

[00:55:01] Maybe they pull their young out of a garden roots and all, or, I don't know. But, uh, there's, there's something about the way we do it that I think the whole galaxy is jealous. Good energy. Isn't it? Energy that, uh, you talked about in the book that John spoke about in the book. Uh, yeah. Well, I mean that, well, that that'll, yeah.

[00:55:23] I mean that, there's many ways to look at that, right? And then we get in, boy, uh, Laura, you just accidentally took me to a very dark place there, because that's, that's what, that's what a lot of the pedophilia and energy harvesting is about. Right? You spoke about that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know, we practice that on a positive way, Bruce, you know, we, I, I, I have, I have sex rituals that I do that are positive, and I use it to charge myself up with energy and know my own personal process is extremely powerful, and I can get myself into a massively high volume of light.

[00:55:56] I just don't give any of it away, you know? And then there's no, there's no thought, there's no projection. So it's, it's, uh, you know, it's, it's not all a negative thing. It's, uh, you know, it's, it's just, it's in our face everywhere we look, this, they, they've, uh, they've infiltrated everything, haven't they? You know?

[00:56:10] But I don't think they're as powerful as they make out. I, I would agree. They're, they're not as powerful as they make out, but yeah, it, it, it, it probably has something to do with the Kendall, uh, kini energy. I mean, sex is an inherently multidimensional experience, right? So, um, and it's a very powerful experience.

[00:56:29] Human, human sexuality is very powerful. You know, it's a, I almost, something just popped into my mind. Um, the, the Daryl Hock character in the original, you know, blade Runner, the Nexus six pleasure model. Yeah. It's almost like the, the human, the human skin suit is some kind of galactic pleasure model and, and e ets come here.

[00:56:50] Right. So it's, it's interesting from, from now on when my partner, uh, Gabrielle's on the menstrual cycle, I'll be thrown away. Thrown away the straight away the bin.

[00:57:12] Gotta get a Sam sword. You'll be alright. Yeah. Yeah. And a, a question I was not going to ask, but I feel like I will, will ask this. Um, and I think Andrew brushed up upon it a little bit, was. The irony of obviously the book coming out and John passing and everything like that throughout that period of time, what are your thoughts on that?

[00:57:31] Because I know a lot of people will be conspiracy talking about that and that era of time when John passed away. Okay, Dale, this is, this is a hard question. I mean, hard emotionally, uh, intellectually it's very fulfill. So about about two years after the book came out, or actually two and a half years after the book came out, so the book came out December 31st, 2019.

[00:57:56] Galactic Historian came out June 12th, 2021. A couple months after the galactic historian came out. Um, there was tremendous motion on Stardust, meaning it started to garner a lot of interest. We had TV producers approach us and we had a couple of, um, A couple of scientists. One, one was a postgraduate doctoral fellow at the Harvard Medical School, and the other one was, um, a, um, a guy working in the private sector doing funded research who had a PhD in medical physics.

[00:58:37] And they contacted, now you've all read the book and you, you, you remember what I said about the medical Harvard School. So this is how this, I wake up one morning, there's a LinkedIn message from a guy who's, his title is post-doctoral fellow, uh, Harvard Medical School. You know, I won't give his name. Says, hi Bruce.

[00:58:56] I'd like to talk to you about Stardust Ranch. Would you be available? And I'm thinking, oh, now Harvard finally got her around to reading the book and they're pissed because I went through the whole John Mack thing and everything. And so no, but that, that wasn't the case. This, this guy is actually a very spiritual fellow, a Sri Lankan fellow, a Buddhist, and was thrilled with the book, and they wanted to do this research.

[00:59:19] And then simultaneously at the same time, these TV producers came in. And at every stage I had to push John A. Little bit. Like he, he, and he had kind of limits. He, he had a duty to get his story out and he was very happy with the book. But getting it out beyond that, he, John, I think, I don't wanna say anything.

[00:59:43] He had trust issues with the world, the world of commerce, contracts, the TV shows, uh, you know, things like he had, he had trust issues with these people. That's one dimension of it. Here's what he told me in a private call. He said, Bruce, if we go forward with this, We're gonna upset the balance of things.

[01:00:01] I've kind of achieved a truce with this ranch. I'm allowed to tell the world what's going on here. So when you write a book, it's sort of a voluntary thing. You know, people have to make an effort to read a book. Number one, they have to buy it or borrow it from a friend. And number two, they have to devote, depending on how fast they read, 4, 6, 8 hours.

[01:00:22] It's a big investment. It's not, uh, it, it's not like binge watching a Netflix series or something. So because of the very nature of writing, you're not forcing things on anybody. You're not forcing your story, you're not giving it away too easily. And the people who find it and absorb it, were meant to find.

[01:00:38] And it's not really sort of upsetting the whole ecosystem. Of Stardust Ranch. He said, when the academics come in and the TV people come in, I'm gonna end up in a big war on the ranch. And I said, John, it's your call. I said, I'm, I'm happy to have helped you write this book. You know, you know me John, I make my living technical writing.

[01:00:58] I have a good trade. I don't need the TV money. It's your call. And he, he waited about a week and he said, okay, let's go ahead and do it. And then, and then he got killed and they killed him. Mm-hmm. There's no doubt about, you know, after the reading, Melissa and Andrew gave on the Memorial Shul for John, he did not die accidentally.

[01:01:17] It was not his time. He was taken out. Mm-hmm. And I've always had a little bit of issue with that, you know? Because, uh, if I had to, I think now, if I had told him, well, let's not do the TV series. Let's not do the, but I used to come back with like, well, why did you write the book if you didn't want to get your story?

[01:01:35] I kind of, I kind of prodded him a little bit and, and I, I've had to deal with some of that since he passed. Now, John's around all the time. He can visit and clean up this energy and say, ah, don't worry about it. You know, it's, I, I'm, I'm, I made a free will choice. Stop, stop Martyring yourself, Bruce, and stuff like that.

[01:01:53] But his, there are, Conspiracy. Think conspiracy theorists think the world is run by a small group of people. It, but it's not the case. It's, it's, it's it's series of groups and energy constructs and things like this. And Stardust RA ranches is an example of this. Okay? Now, one of the reasons Stardust Ranch is protected and guarded so much by the ETS is that it is still, since we've all read the galactic historian here, so we know that a lot of the genetic material, uh, trade on this planet has been shut down, but there are still smuggling rat holes.

[01:02:29] Okay? Stardust Ranch is a smuggling rat hole. Okay? It's profitable, it's a profitable place. And this is why Andrew continually referred as a cartel war there. Because it's almo, you know, SS smuggling the human d n a in whatever other parts of astral parts of humans, they move around. It's no different than the Columbian cocaine trade or anything.

[01:02:52] It's, it's smuggling. And there are, there are forces of balance on law on the other side that are hunting these smugglers as well. And John Edmunds is smack dab in the middle of all this, holding his ground with a samurai sword and a kennel full of Rottweilers. You know,

[01:03:13] this is the, the timeline, Bruce, there was. So when the book came out, how long ago, uh, when did he pass, how, how long after the book was released? So the book came out December for 30. You're gonna have to do the math. I'm horrible at math. Yeah. It's one of the consequences of having a writing gift. Um, you get, you get by with grade nine math skills.

[01:03:35] Um, the book came out December 31st, 2019, and John died February 28th, 2022. Wow. So yeah, two months. Oh, no, no. Two, two years. Two years. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Well, um, 20 20, 20 21. Uh, just, yeah. Three years and, and a bit or, or just under three years. And what was the, when you said there was a TV programming process, what was happening with that when that was going on?

[01:04:04] Was it in the midst of being made and created and stuff like that, or? Oh, yeah. They had started negotiation. The two, there was one o o overseer producer who had a record of performance in this, in this field, had TV shows. And then she brought in a married couple from LA and we started having Skype conversations.

[01:04:23] And then they actually went out to Stardust Ranch, and they didn't stay at the ranch. They stayed at a hotel, but they did visit during the day and spend time on the ranch. And I mean, this, th this, uh, was in full development and they had an offer on the table and everything. And then, but John refused to sell his rights, right?

[01:04:42] He, he would not sell the rights unless he maintained absolute control of the story. So, you know, the same story we hear from all kinds of people in the 20th century engaging with Hollywood, you know, um, I think the best example, I can think of it on the top of my head is the brilliant Cohen Brothers movie, Bart and Fink, you know, but the New York playwright going to Hollywood.

[01:05:04] So John had his own Hollywood battle, um, but they were willing to work with him to some degree, and the negotiations were ongoing. And then, and then he, he was killed. Can you imagine, Bruce, if you were, if you were a drug dealer and that was your main port, that's where everything came in. Everything came out.

[01:05:22] That was the only place you could do it, right? And then all of a sudden you knew there was gonna be camera crews coming in. And even if it was one of those shows that took the Mickey out of it, then you're definitely gonna start having idiots turn up. Everywhere filming it, kids driving around, camping out at night, you know, all this stuff's gonna start to happen and you know, if that's their main port of that kind of economy, then Maddy, it already was it al just with the book, it already was, people were coming out in camper vans and spending the night outside his gate.

[01:05:50] And I was hearing these stories all the time. You know, he, and, and I mean, just, just imagine being, you know, four, four or six people in a Volkswagen van. You've driven, li like over five states to go see Stardust Ranch. You're camped out in front, it's 12 o'clock at night and John Edmonds shows up at the side window with a shotgun.

[01:06:11] The hell are you doing here? Rotweiler failing over cave. Like, what the fuck you doing? He was doing Aquin. He was doing aquin in no reality. Yeah. Yeah. Like these, these, look, you don't want, you don't wanna tinker with these forces too much. You don't, you know, it's a, it's a tremendous curiosity, but, you know, a Andrew, Andrew gives very, very sound advice and caution about curiosity learning and stuff like that, right?

[01:06:39] If you're meant, if you're meant to interact ET with ets, it'll come about na. I've never met anyone who's meditated consistently longer than five years who doesn't have ET experiences. Yes. As soon as, as soon as you raise your vibration a little bit, they're gonna come and check you out. Yeah. Right? And thi this is, this is what happened to me in 2003 when I came home from the 12, uh, 12 week writing retreat.

[01:07:04] And, and I was just completely lit up. And so the ets were checking me out, right? So if you're on a path to consciousness, you're gonna go through your own version of the ET movement. The only reason, and it's part of our birthright to ha to be able to interact with these beings and to be able to use them as an adjunct to our human experience, to ask questions all once we open up, when, when, when this Cali Yuga dark age or whatever it is, is done.

[01:07:31] And we go, every, this is gonna be normal peop people are gonna look back at, at the, at the dark ages where we didn't have this galactic consciousness as part of our birthright as extremely primitive and dark, like the dark ages. So everybody's gonna start having et experiences because human consciousness is involuntarily rising.

[01:07:53] Now it's just part of Okay, bye-bye. Just going over to her mother's house. Um, And, um, so, you know, this is, so I had had my ET experiences already. I started, you know, my spiritual journey at 17, turning 18. But I've had a whole bunch of experiences other than ets. There's, I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there other than ets, you know, I mean, um, and, and, and so I, I find the whole ET thing a little bit fascinating in how it just fascinates people.

[01:08:25] And I would say to people, look, if you're overly fascinated about this and you, you've been like an et groupie for years, but you've never had an experience, may maybe just let it go for a while. Maybe it's not all that healthy for you. And, uh, you know, and really what it signals, if you're not having the experiences and interacting with them and you're an ET groupie, really what it tells me is you're not happy with your human life and you're looking for some, something else, some type, some type of ex escape.

[01:08:51] So get, get the happiness, balance and grounding in your life. Those ETS will find you. They're very sociable. Very, very sociable. I have to interact, I have to interject here as well. Cause the thing is with et contact is, the type of contact you can have is down to your DNA as well. Your DNA attracts certain types, so, you know, some people could have more prone to negative et interactions, other people positive.

[01:09:13] But you know, if, if you haven't done any form of self-mastery for any small amount of time or even, you know, medium amount of time, then it can lean towards the negative. You know, you work your way up towards that positive interaction and it will happen eventually, but not if you're trying to make it happen.

[01:09:32] That's the thing. Yeah. And, and when you're trying pushing it, that's when usually someone will come knocking who really you don't really want hanging about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A absolutely. Absolutely. And if you do have a negative experience, I mean, take a page outta John Edmond's book. Okay? Don't, don't be afraid, man.

[01:09:49] Stand your ground. And, and, and that's the rule of thumb for everything. Malignant spirits on the other side. Demonic. Stand your groundman. Don't be arrogant about it, but stand your sovereign ground. That's the advice Alex call your advice. Every contact e-gift and John Edmunds doubles down on that.

[01:10:06] Whether or not you have a samurai sword about boundaries. About boundaries. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Ummm, Dale, are, do you have a sequence of questions you're getting to or can I just form jazz here? Yeah, I've got, I've got a few, quite a few questions. Oh, sure. So got a lot of questions to go. Go right, go right ahead.

[01:10:30] Um, go right ahead. So the, um, the ranch at the moment, cause I, uh, I added John on Facebook and I think his wife's taken over his Facebook account. Yep, yep. And she's been posting, uh, looking for donations. What's the update on her? Is, uh, is it, what I'm thinking is they're trying to take the ranch off her basically, and, and.

[01:10:50] Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's gonna go into some kind of public auction or semi-public auction, and probably, probably some arm of US intelligence will take it over, under, under the guise of a corporation or something, you know? And, um, maybe that's for the best. Okay. Because I'm, I'm not sure human beings should be going there and screwing around too much and, and stuff like that, right?

[01:11:16] So, um, there's a bit of sadness in that story. But on the other hand, I think it's really good if Joyce gets off the ranch now that John's gone. You know, he, he, he was a lot of protection for her psychically and physically, and I think, I think the sooner she gets off the ranch the better. Right. I speak to her about once every month, once every month, twice a month.

[01:11:37] I mean, that, that, that, that book it's sales, it's just as consistent as a Polish pension comes in every month. It, it just, and it, it beguiles me because we're not doing any marketing and it just keeps selling about the same amount every month, which is about 500 bucks. Us, you know, I, I, I, I, I refer to it as like my old age pension.

[01:11:58] It just keeps coming in and coming in and, and I'm going, well, it, it, and it's all just word of mouth and that kind of organic marketing is the best to be a part of, and it, it's more like a, kind of like a cult phenomenon, you know, like Buckaroo Bonzai or Blade Runner of the movie before it caught on. And I like that.

[01:12:16] It makes me feel good as a writer, you know? Mm-hmm. And I'd, I'd love to ask the question as well, so, The time period of when, um, you stopped talking to John, you were about to start the book and something happened. What happened then? Uh, when you stopped writing and you connected again in the future with him?

[01:12:35] Oh, okay. So we were introduced by a mutual friend and, um, and, and my friend huge into, um, Spirituality movement. Very interesting guy in his own right. He lives in Hawaii. He called me up one day now. He had read my first, he had read God as an economist, uh, Laura, and, and um, you know, he had gotten to know John.

[01:13:01] He was, he was an adept U f O researcher himself. He had, he had, he had friends who'd been locked up in asylums because they captured video and it was too early. And they, this is lady anyway, huge figure in the ET community. Calls me up one day. He says, look, I got a story for you. I said, I said, I'll say his first name.

[01:13:18] I said, Tommy, tell me I don't do nonfiction. I'm, I'm, I'm a novel writer. I'm Earnest Hemingway. I'm, you know, I don't do this kind of writing. He says, oh, you gotta see that. You're not gonna believe this story. This guy's killing gray aliens with a Samurai sword and you're not gonna believe. And they, and they got dna and, and they.

[01:13:36] Sent the DNA to a lab in Michigan. Bruce, you gotta write this. Just do me a favor and meet the guy. I said, okay, I'll meet the guy. So we set up a Skype call and, and I met John and I went, yeah, there's, there's something really weird going on here. I said, I said, okay, I'm gonna do this story. I do have a journalism degree.

[01:13:54] I don't have a master's in fine arts, creative writing. Maybe I should do this book. I know how to write non-fiction. I, I paid $40,000 in student loans to learn how to write non-fiction. So I may as well try this book. Got into the book, and I am telling you, this was about 2012, okay? And my skin was just crawling and I could not control my fear.

[01:14:22] And, and it was drawing all kinds of things in. Now, for those people always ask me, well, where's the genetic material? Where are the alien bodies? Spruce. Well, for a while he kept them in his freezer, but, um, generally they were shipped out. Okay. So the, the, he sh he shipped them out to a guy who was a botanist by the name of Dr.

[01:14:50] Levin Goode in Michigan. Now, Dr. Levin Goode was a, a classically trained botanist who got interested in the U F O field about five years before meeting John Edmonds because he had done some research and crop analysis at a cellular and molecular level on crop circles. And he said, okay, the, you know, there's really something to this.

[01:15:14] So this, this was the genesis for John to go public cuz he, he didn't want to go public and face Rick and he wanted to go public with evidence. So this is, this is how him and Tommy got the book going. Okay. So in, in tandem with the release of this book, there would be physical evidence. Okay? So I'm working on the book for like four or five months, six months maybe.

[01:15:37] And I'm talking to John Edmonds two, three hours a day recording the Skype conversations, transcribing them in building chapters.

[01:15:48] So at the end of this process, um, Dr. Levin Goode and his wife died suddenly. And when I say suddenly, I mean, and I'm not joking, when slip slipped on a banana peel and cracked their head open, one of them. Okay. That, that's what I mean by sudden, which is a little, and when that happened with my skin crawling already and ev everything, when Dr.

[01:16:09] Levin Good was out of the picture, I used it as an excuse. I said, well, we don't have the evidence anymore. I'm not putting my name behind this book. This is just crazy. But really, I was afraid. And here I am up here, I am up here in the beginning of 2019 and it just, it just starts again in my head. First of all, there's a lot of orbs here.

[01:16:27] So there were orbs over my hes, and then it got me thinking about 2012 and working with John Edmonds and I said, okay, I'm gonna give him a call and I'm gonna finish this book cuz I'm in a very safe place now. Spiritually protected. And I'm a different person than I was in 2012. And I'm gonna write the book now.

[01:16:44] And I, that's when I called him and decided to write the book. But the general reason I quit was it was just too frightening. Mm-hmm. It was, um, and, and, and the botanist and his wife died within a week of each other, and all the lab material disappeared. Mm-hmm. So there are, there, there, there. Yeah. Gimme a moment.

[01:17:05] Just give me a moment. I gotta think about this. See, I, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna put any fear out there. Um, but look, I don't know what's going on now in 2022, how heavily these things are policed. But in 2012, they were, and if you were gonna go, if you were gonna go public with evidence, like real evidence of ets, physical evidence, there was a good chance you would, it was very much like the free energy movement in the fifties where people would develop water, cars and stuff like this.

[01:17:35] The first visit is, Hey, we'll give you a million bucks for that. You know, you made that in your, you know, the second visit is you can't take this to market. The third visit is your dad. It's the same, it's the same thing with the ET movement. So Dr. Levin Good was killed. So you may, you may ask yourself, well, why didn't they just kill John Edmonds?

[01:17:55] Good luck with that.

[01:18:00] Like killing Bruce Lee. How long took them get Bruce Lee? I think they were very afraid of John. And it's, they, you know, it, it's not like there weren't shots taken. Adam, that's described and imagine just going about your business one day and you, you're walking between your house and your bodega where you keep your saddles and everything and suddenly there's a sniper shooting at you.

[01:18:21] Right. This, this was John Edmond's life. It wasn't just the ets, he was physically attacked as well, right. It said like, really the ultimate warrior in many ways, you know, And any, any questions, Laura, Mattie, or anything you want to, to ask about as well? Just there are times Bruce, despite you could say the gravity of the subject that I honestly, I wanted to burst out laughing with some of it.

[01:18:52] I mean, you can't just, just how he was and what he did was just so larger than life. Yeah. And one of those is, is the Mormon gentle Oh, that, that, yes, yes. That's what Spoiler alert. So that was one. And then obviously when he learned to control his, his thoughts, so the grays couldn't tell. What he was thinking and where he was going and how he surprised them.

[01:19:25] Um, there are some moments I, I did actually burst out laughing, so I think there, there is a, there is levity in the book. Yeah. Not just joy. Yes, there is other levity in the book. So just, just briefly for, for the listeners who haven't read the book yet, the Mormon bishop for that area of Arizona came out with, um, two Mormons to do an exorcism and just imagine this.

[01:19:51] Okay, so normal social visit. Joyce would go to the, to kitchen probably to make coffee and maybe a little bit of snack food for them. And they, they commenced their feeling out of the ranch and everything. And before the coffee and biscuits are ready or anything, the, the three Mormons are in the van, like the Scooby do team taking off.

[01:20:11] And John's like, I don't think we're gonna need that coffee. Joyce,

[01:20:19] with the TV guy. That electrician, it's the same sort of thing, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sir. We don't like to come out here. It's got a very bad reputation. And then why there were so many phone lines in the house because it was a, it was an offsite gambling den and a bordello, you know? And it is unbelievable.

[01:20:43] Unbelievable. And you've, you've got to think as well, like even Joyce, um, talk about Joyce for a bit of how strong of a person she is and for someone Yeah. To, to hold and, and obviously h hit her being part of John's life's backbone. And obviously, yeah, she was there through it all. And fair the credit or credit to Joyce, because what an exceptional woman.

[01:21:03] What a great woman to be able to go through all of that and keep sane. Because a lot of people who have visit the ranch, they've gone visit it. Those Syrians, one of them went away and got psychotic because they had like, and it gets to you, doesn't it? If you're not strong enough. And them two were so strong to be able to do that.

[01:21:20] And someone got, I think someone shot themself, didn't they before we lived there. Uh, so for them to enjoys, like just hats off to Joyce really for, for what she's done and how strong she's been through it. Yeah. So one, one of the Syrians went underground with his family, and the other one was institutionalized.

[01:21:37] After that, the purple lightning day, Bernie lost her memory for three or four years. Uh, j Joyce tells a story, I don't think it's in the book, but you know, just talking to her, she tells a story of like a year after the incident bumping into, um, Brandy, I think at, uh, a new age bookstore in Phoenix or something.

[01:21:57] And, and Brandy had very little recollection of it. It took four years for the memory to Oh, she got blasted by Li Purple. Lightning went through the ground through, you know, and, um, shoes, didn't it? Yeah, yeah. Cartoon, you know, that is in the book. Um, what Joy says that is in the book. Yeah, in the, in the afterward.

[01:22:19] Yeah. Sorry, Bruce, how calmness to come home with what he showed her he'd done that day. She was very matter of fact and very calm about this situation, chilling in the freezer.

[01:22:41] It, it, it became their normal, right? So I mean, they, they, they, they lived it for 25 years and Joyce is still living it. Although I think probably, I think John on the other side is policing that for her. I don't, I don't think too much will be bothering her. I think he, I think he's much more powerful.

[01:22:59] Basically, it's the Obi one Kenobi story, right? I think he's much more powerful on the other side now, right? Mm-hmm. Yep. And you know, I feel him around me every once in a while. He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he's popped in a couple times, even since my dad passed, just to say, man, you know, it's, it's natural. Don't worry about it.

[01:23:15] It's all cool. On the other side. He'll do, is that, you know, And he's around, you know, he's, he's dropping in on Melissa and Andrew all the time. Mm-hmm. You know, so, and his suffering is over. Right. I mean, John was always a huge, huge man, nearly 300 pounds. And, and you know, at the end he was down to like 145 pounds.

[01:23:36] Wow. And this was due to illnesses that had come about in the last two years before his death. Right. So, yeah. Wow. Yeah. I love talking about the guy, man. I love celebrating his life, you know, and I'm very honored to be able to do it. It's just one of these great people in history that society doesn't even have the consciousness to yet to understand why he was great.

[01:24:02] Right. But they will, they will in the future, as more and more people begin having these experiences, which are gonna happen inevitably, they're, they're, they're, they're going to start happening as the whole communication spectrum with this race opens up. And we're we're taken out of isolation and, and lockdown, so to speak.

[01:24:20] People will remember John Edmonds quite fondly as an early pioneer of this kind of living and consciousness, perhaps involuntarily

[01:24:33] and that bit. What gave me the chills, and I, I'm not gonna lie, I, I got a bit scared. There was like a, there, there's a slight moment where my little fear child came out and I went, holy shit. Uh, was the, the part where he went for a meal. And you, he turns his phone on and he gets a missed call from his wife, and he's out, out, meant to be out with Joyce, and he realizes, obviously the goat to the toilet.

[01:24:57] And that was just like, it's like a movie. You, it's, it gave me the chilly willies and I was just like, fuck Yeah. For a while. Yeah. Yeah. And it, it, it, it, it happened to both of them. So there were doppelganger johns that appeared to Joyce and there was Doppelganger Joyce that appeared to John. And I had never heard anything like that in my life.

[01:25:21] Subsequent to writing Stardust Ranch, I have heard a little bit about it. Now I've tuned into it in the occult lore that it, it is possible to fabricate a second body like that temporarily. There are, there are entities and beings out there that can do it, but it's just, just, it's a creep show, man. You know?

[01:25:38] And, and some, most ets can literally manifest wherever they want. They can change their physical, it's just a light. They can do it. They can come up you however you want. I think I remember Andrew saying Grays are one of those who can zip up a suit. They actually have a zip up suit. Yeah. You remember him saying that?

[01:25:57] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They're like the, the mechanical beings, aren't they? What, what? Don't really have a tree of life. They just literally go in, put the suit on, and they can have many different consciousnesses actually in there. Not just one. There could be up to 30 or 20 different consciousness in the, in the actual gray.

[01:26:13] It's crazy. Yeah. Human beings are so easy to trick. They really are. Yeah. And then another thing I learned from John, it's, it's, it's not as much in the book. It is a little bit, when we get into Crossroads and the later chapters crossroads, it really, it really is a one-to-one match with what Andrew was saying about what the Industrial Revolution had done to the human consciousness.

[01:26:35] So I, I already had this bridge to Andrew's work. Right. Um, But, uh, uh, sorry, I lost my train of thought there. Sorry. This hap I get excited and I I just lose it. What were we talking about? I'll tell you what, man. The, the, the air around me is freaky dey right now, mate. Honestly, as we're talking about this, all the stuff that's going on around in my sort of unseen world, it's absolutely nuts.

[01:27:01] Can I, can I just, can I just be honest with you what experience I happened at? I looked quite shocked and got a bit spooked out because, I'm looking out at the sky now and it's clear and there's a huge cloud and I could tell it was a shear. And while you were talking, Bruce, this was about 10 minutes ago.

[01:27:14] I wasn't gonna talk about it, but I've looked up and soon as I looked down and looked up, it disappeared. And I'm not taught. It was a humongous cloud, which you could tell was a ship and completely gone now and I can't see it. And it get i'll, I'll try and record it my face when I look up and I start looking a bit freaked out.

[01:27:30] I'm like, what's going on? It's going on in this too, man. I've had John come in and there's been all these other sort of, I don't know, some not nice ones, then some nice ones, and it's been, it's been just like a light show. It was really unique experience. Yeah, he's, he's a controversial figure even over there on the other side still.

[01:27:51] And, uh, Yeah, I remember what I was talking about now, like the crossroads chapter and how we get into all of this stuff. And look, it, it's, it is really funny to, to hear John like describe his encounters with Palladian and stuff like that because, and Nord, he had a lot of encounters with Nordics as well.

[01:28:11] And he said, look, I mean, there, he, I said, well, why don't they help us, John, you know, stupid naive freshman question. He goes, you know, he says Bruce to us. He says to them we're kind of like a dog stuck in a, like a four-lane traffic and like, well do your risk getting hit by a car or go out there and save the dog, or you just let the fate line work out.

[01:28:33] And I thought that was a little bit cold at the time, but I've grown into it. I understand what he meant. We're on our own and this is why spiritual work is so important. Stop asking other people for help except maybe the creator and your prayers and your guardians and stuff. Do your spiritual work. Man.

[01:28:49] Okay. And stop asking for every, this is what they conditioned in the 20th century was some institutional figure will fix this. Well, the government listen to how to fix this, you know? Mm-hmm. And this is, this is what the X-files and these shows do, is they, they create the confidence in people. Oh, the government's got this all handled.

[01:29:05] We have a special, no, they don't. You're on your own. And the, and the, the only thing you have to fight back with is your own consciousness and your own spirit. So start your work, start your journey. It's important. I used to say, I used to say to my son when I started meditating at 17 years old in 1982, it was a lifestyle choice.

[01:29:25] I'd say in, in 2022. It's self-defense. Now, if you don't, if you don't have a spiritual life going on, now you're g you're gonna get braced. You know? What do I mean? You know, what do I mean by braced? I mean, like, taken into the corner hard and rough, like in a hockey game with the cross-checking and everything, you're gonna get braced.

[01:29:44] You know? So you, and maybe this is what the human race needs. Maybe a little fear shake is what some people need to, you know, the sort of zen W with the b b, the wack with the bamboo stick by the zen master when you're deviating from your meditation. Maybe that's what the human race needs now, you know, well back in corner, Bruce backed into the corner.

[01:30:02] If you back enough people into a corner, then somebody's gonna charge, you know? Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. Absolutely. But you know what? We must pick a fight. That's the, that's the fundamental to all of this. It comes with the ET contacts and that as well. Sacred neutral. Yeah. He was defending his la his land.

[01:30:19] Okay. He was defending his land. Very different thing. No one was gonna help him cuz no one could talk about what was going on. But, you know, as, as a personal practitioner, uh, uh, you know, just don't pick a fight. Cuz if you pick a fight, you'll, you'll get a fight. And you have to be very aware of the subtleties of how you can pick a fight.

[01:30:34] You know, even if it's with yourself, it always ends badly, you know, always ends badly. But when it's the other way around, you just try to be better. Even if you fail, try again and fail, try again. And it always leads you to another direction. And the world as crazy as it is out there is what it is out there, but you view it in a completely different way to the majority of the world.

[01:30:51] People do. Even just with, you know, even just with a few years of, of general practice, you surely you're gonna have a different point of view. You're just not getting bounced off the wall by everything that everyone's saying. Yeah. I think it's also, you know how, go ahead Laura. See how do you want to see the universe expand?

[01:31:08] Because we are intrinsically linked to the expansion of the universe through our consciousness. Yeah. So we have a choice of how, how we want to interact or to exchange energy or, you know, whatever. With, with the universe, what do we want to create? Because the universe, it's ever flowing. And that's story again.

[01:31:30] And, and the era of light we're in now. So we don't actually have to fight anymore. Maybe before thousands of years ago when the world was a different place, uh, we had to fight and we had to stand our ground. But now, like Andrew talks about cern, um, I think on one of, I think I to, I heard him, I think he was on a show last week and he talked about the update of cern and he said basically they've got them by the bottom neck, that they won't be doing anything magnificent like they did in 2013.

[01:31:56] Or they will get taken out on all space times, dimensions, certain will just get obl obliviated. So it feels like. No. Fight is the fight now. And like you say, Bruce, self mastery, self-healing is the way to engage and reach the stars. Really, very, very timely comment. It's the fourth today. And that certain thing is supposed to happen tomorrow on the fifth.

[01:32:16] Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's the time Andrew's right? It's the time of the peacemaker, okay? Mm-hmm. We all, we all need to become peacemakers now. There's no, you know, and this, this ties, boy, this is huge. Even let's bring this right back to normal human stuff. Huge in the passing of my father. I need to make peace with this bastard, you know?

[01:32:36] And peace is what it's all about. Now, evening, evening out. Your karma. A admitting what you did, letting go of your stubbornness and, and all of these sorts of things. Everything. If, if it's. True for your dad when he passes. It's true for the ET is the popin. And, and, and going back to cer, I think it, I remember what we talked about now was 20 13, 20 14, basically C turned on and it started using, uh, timelines stuff.

[01:33:03] It started fucking with the timelines and now it was, it was about to do that again. But all the galactic beings and people are obviously here, basically said to Sir, if you turn this shit on, we're gonna take you out and take all CN out in all space times and realities. So it feels like this is, we have one, we've really, yeah, one in a way it's just now self mastery.

[01:33:23] It's about us realizing how much of a master we are instead of the external taking over us anymore. And there was, I couldn't agree more. Yeah, there was a, um, I think what happens, the light that comes in 20 13, 20 14 was a really expansive time. You know, it was an incredible time. The dream world was nuts.

[01:33:42] The, the time of the event as well. And what they were trying to do is there was, it's like there was so much light coming in that CER was able to kind of block it out. So you just miss a fraction of the code that you're supposed to be getting. Just small pieces, you know? Yeah. But now I think it's time that this code, it is just gotta happen.

[01:34:00] They can't keep the co they, you know, this, it's time though, isn't it, as well? It's, it's, it's not just now, it's all these other times as well, you know? Yeah. All interacting together. It's so huge. It's just so difficult to even get your head around. And I think it's the importance of why we're doing this stuff that we do nowadays.

[01:34:15] You know, even if it, even if not that many people see it, it'll be there for the future. Because as this stuff becomes more known and people start to practice, then all this stuff is gonna be out there for him already. You know, it's a hard thing to learn, isn't it? It's a hard thing to learn. It takes many, many years, especially, you know, along with the self mastery as well, coupled along with all of the learning of the new terminologies and the wisdom and the different teachings and applying them.

[01:34:38] It's a big, big job. And, uh, you know, it's, I think it's good for those people in the future that don't know about it yet. There there should be an infrastructure there for them, and I guess that is the great awakening, really. That's how we out of it. Yeah, absolutely. And I, I, I feel compelled to say something here.

[01:34:54] I'm on my own path. I've benefited enormously, uh, from being the galactic historian. And I just wanna say that, you know, getting to know you guys, I bear witness Andrew's material if applied with discipline works faster than almost any other path on the planet. You are all, you are all beautifully unfolded people.

[01:35:17] I've been schlepping away at my meditation path for 35 years. You guys are there in two years. You know, it took me 10, took me 10, 9, 9 to 10. Yeah. Yeah. I really were. If, if you, if you connect with Andrew's material and, and you find it fascinating reading the galactic historian start the practices and his practical spiritual path is all free on paper.

[01:35:42] You can download the revocations and, and, uh, I think, I think he's offering the mystical life now, but it's very, very powerful material folks and very rapid. Make sure you're everything that, so sorry Bruce. Make sure you're ready for it though, because it will be phenomenological. It's, this is not a belief system.

[01:36:01] It's not, it's not Maddie's dad. It's not a book. Stuff's gonna pop into your life, man. Great. What he's given out for free is everything You need to actually become a master of your own reality. You can chop and change it, fix it to your own means, but the other stuff that he offers takes you above and beyond a bit quicker.

[01:36:24] Oh, yeah. But you kind of get there and then have to catch up with yourself, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Net never, never incredible figure in our timeline, Andrew Bar says, and it was really a pleasure for me to facilitate the meeting between him and John and, and to sit on the Skype call for that want for four hours.

[01:36:42] We were all, all prime. Did you record it? Never invaded privacy like that.

[01:36:52] I cried. I went through two or three crying belts. It was extremely powerful, man. Extremely powerful. Yeah. He, he really has. And, and for, for me, I think the last, when my father died, I had a session with Andrew probably about four weeks after. And he, he gave me so many things to ponder on about my own life and about my journey and, uh, the stuff I'm doing now.

[01:37:15] I, I teach psychic surgery, advanced training, and as well as the psychic surgery stuff. The, the discipline and the schedule comes along with that. And I remember being at a low point and I just felt in limbo. And I had the session, I was just flat and I just said, I feel so, so strange. I just don't have any emotion.

[01:37:31] And at the end, he drops a little nugget there just to put, plant that little seed in my mind. And that was it. From that expansion, from that dark time, uh, yeah, he's, he's really, I'd say him personally, has helped me find self-mastery, self-healing, and actually realize how powerful I am. And, and I am, I am a being of truth.

[01:37:51] I am a being of love. I've had so many fucking things go on in my life. And yeah, like you say, Bruce, back to the teachings, back to the discipline, back to having variety in the schedule. For me, it took probably, I'd say two years for my repetition with Illumination to come where I was like, every single ounce I put extra into me.

[01:38:10] I was like, wow. I was like, this is why I'm fucking doing it. And I, and I remember hearing repetition with illumination eight, nine years ago and I said, I wonder what that feels like. And I started feeling it. I like, holy shit like this. Is it nice? Yeah. I see your, I see all your pictures on Facebook, uh, Dale, when you go on your sweat lodges and stuff or do, everybody looks just so lit up, so happy.

[01:38:34] It really is. And and the first session I had with him was my instant gratification questions. Yeah. That they completely change. I listened to myself. I'm like, what the fuck am I asking? Like needed some validation back then 10 years ago. Yeah. Give validation. He then,

[01:38:58] Yeah. So thank you so much guys. And Bruce, I'd love to have you on again at some point because it's truly one of my, this has been one of my favorite shows. It's been so fun. And to talk about John Edmonds and his legacy and his life and what that book's taught me, and I'm sure a lot of people reading it in the future and the, and the past.

[01:39:16] It's been incredible. And Bruce, for you being part of that, it's an honor to have you on the show. And thank you for coming on again. Oh, my pleasure. Love to spend time with you guys. Mm-hmm. Likewise. Yeah. And thank you, Matt, Mattie, and Laura, I appreciate you both as well. Thank you for coming on and, and co-hosting as well.

[01:39:34] You, you really have up to my level of, of, um, podcasting, so to say, making me wanna do it more and like really looking forward to doing them a lot more. So thank you for, for bringing your presence as well. Yeah, mate.

[01:39:55] I've got to do the kids' bedtime routine. Now I've got to say their prayers and put them to bed. It's like a bit of a routine I do with them. Um, oh, that's so beautiful. Thanks Bruce. Great. Get some more insight on the book. Really appreciate that. And yeah, let's it, yes. What is going on with Laura? You, you seem like a different woman somehow.

[01:40:19] You're just so radiant. So if, if my wife spoke English, I'd get punched in the face. Right now you, you're just, I don't know. I don't know what you did this weekend, but you're just glowing. I dunno. Too much sun. I love the sun. That's how I recharge my battery and that's what I recommend to everybody. Okay.

[01:40:41] Go in the sun. Yeah. Okay. Get the light. Yeah. Okay. I think, I think that's it, but thank you. That's kind. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay guys, thanks. Lovely. And thank you for everyone for watching the show. Goodbye. I'm just gonna,
